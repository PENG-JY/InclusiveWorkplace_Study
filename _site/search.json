    "text": "Unsupervised learning techniques are crucial for exploring hidden patterns and structures in data without predefined labels. In the context of gender equality and corporate performance, unsupervised learning allows us to identify natural groupings or relationships between companies based on financial performance, gender equality scores, and leadership diversity. These techniques are particularly useful when we aim to discover intrinsic patterns, such as how certain corporate characteristics correlate with higher gender equality scores or financial success.\nIn this study, we aim to use unsupervised learning methods to uncover underlying patterns within the dataset of companies’ financial indicators and gender equality measures. By clustering companies based on these characteristics, we can identify different groups of companies that exhibit similar profiles in terms of gender equality, leadership diversity, and financial performance. The insights from these clusters can help uncover systemic barriers, trends, or areas for potential improvement in corporate governance and inclusivity practices.\nBy leveraging unsupervised learning techniques, we aim to:\n\nReveal patterns in corporate behavior related to gender equality.\nExplore the association between financial performance and diversity metrics.\nIdentify outliers or high-performing companies that demonstrate exceptional gender equality practices.\n\nThis section will focus on how unsupervised learning models, such as clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques, were applied to analyze company performance and gender equality."

    "text": "Dimensionality Reduction\n\nPCA: PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables known as principal components. These components explain the maximum variance in the data. PCA was used in this study to reduce the complexity of the dataset and identify the most important factors that explain variability in gender equality scores. By applying PCA, we could better visualize the data and identify which assessment dimensions (e.g., workplace environment, compensation and benefits, prevention of violence and harassment) had the greatest influence on the total score.1\nt-SNE: t-SNE is another dimensionality reduction technique, particularly effective for visualizing high-dimensional data in a two- or three-dimensional space. It works by minimizing the divergence between probability distributions in high-dimensional space and their corresponding distributions in lower dimensions. In this study, t-SNE was also applied to explore how companies clustered together based on their gender equality scores.2"

We hope to ensure the stability of the model through data cleaning and explore meaningful insights into gender equality practices within the companies, especially for text data and financial data.\n\n\nOverview of Methods\nFirst, we will merge the company dataset with the financial data set using the CIK (Central Index Key) number as a unique identifier for each company with company gender assessment data set1. As a result, we will generate a large dataset to explore more completely.\nFor text data, we will remove unnecessary punctuation, convert cases, remove stop words, so that we can prepare for subsequent analysis, such as TFIDF.\nFor data normalization, we first use Z-score normalization and then Min-Max scaling.\nTo deal with missing values, we apply different strategies depending on the importance of the variable. For example, for the most critical variables, CIK identifiers, we will delete all missing rows. For relatively less important variables, we use multiple imputation to fill in the missing values because these variables are valuable to the analysis.\nIn order to ensure consistency, some data preprocessing code of some content is displayed in the corresponding part, such as unsupervised learning, and we hope that the audience can understand the reason for our processing more coherently.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Measures such as the mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range were calculated to assess the central tendency and dispersion of variables. In our study, we examined the distribution of gender equality scores to determine whether they were skewed towards higher or lower values.\nFrequency Distribution: Frequency analysis was performed on categorical variables such as CEO gender to understand the proportion of companies with male versus female CEOs. This helped establish a baseline for understanding gender representation in leadership roles across companies in the dataset.\nHistogram and Density Plot: Used to visualize the distribution of continuous variables such as gender equality scores.

To effectively analyze textual data, several techniques were employed to transform raw text into meaningful features that can be used for classification tasks.\n\nTF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): TF-IDF transforms text into numerical features by evaluating the importance of terms in a document relative to the whole dataset. It helps identify key terms such as “gender balance”, “pay equity”, and “women-owned businesses”, which highlight a company’s commitment to gender equality.\nSentiment Analysis: Sentiment analysis classifies text into positive, neutral, or negative categories to assess a company’s stance on gender equality issues like pay equity or harassment prevention.\nTopic Modeling: Topic modeling uncovers hidden themes in company policies, helping to identify how companies address aspects like pay gap data collection, violence prevention, and gender balance in leadership.\nKeyword and Network Analysis: Keyword analysis identifies frequently discussed topics related to gender equality, while network analysis visualizes relationships between key terms (e.g., “gender equality” and “pay equity”) to understand company policies.\nFeature Engineering: Features derived from sentiment scores, topic distributions, and keyword frequencies are integrated with numerical data to create a comprehensive dataset for machine learning, offering deeper insights into a company’s gender equality practices."

    "text": "Binary Classification\n\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM)\n\nFeature Selection For SVM\nFeatures:\nDependent Variable:\nGR-B07.EA- Assessment: Whether the company procures from women-owned businesses, which reflects a company’s commitment to diversity and inclusion within its supply chain.\nIndependent Variable:\nAssets (k): The total assets of the company. Assets provide a measure of the company’s overall size and financial stability, reflecting the resources available for operation, expansion, or investments.\nRevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax (k): The revenue generated from contracts with customers, excluding taxes, which reflects the company’s revenue streams.\nOperatingIncomeLoss (k): The operating income or loss of the company. It reflects the company’s ability to generate profit from its regular business operations.\nComprehensiveIncomeNetOfTax (k): The comprehensive income, which is net of taxes. It reflects the overall financial health of the company, considering both operational and non-operational factors.\nTotal: The company’s overall gender equality assessment scores.\nObjective:\nThe objective of choosing the model is to explore the relationship between whether a company procures from women-owned businesses based on selecting financial and operational factors. The target variable, GR-B07.EA-Assessment, is a binary variable that means whether the company engages in procurement from women-owned businesses, reflecting its commitment to diversity and inclusion in the supply chain. This variable is crucial as it helps assess the company’s alignment with gender equity goals and broader social responsibility practices.\nBy using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification, we aim to understand how the selected independent variables—such as company assets, revenue, operating income, comprehensive income, and gender equality scores—affect the company’s willingness and ability to support women-owned businesses. SVM can identify non-linear relationships between these financial indicators and the target variable.\n\n\nModel Selection\n\nModel Rationale:\nThe Support Vector Machine (SVM) is selected for this classification task because it effectively handles both linear and non-linear classification problems, especially with high-dimensional data. SVM is well-suited for predicting whether a company procures from women-owned businesses, using financial and gender equality features, as it maximizes the margin between classes for better generalization. Key advantages of SVM include its ability to handle high-dimensional spaces, suitability for binary classification, capability to capture non-linear relationships through kernel functions, and regularization via the CC parameter, which prevents overfitting by balancing margin maximization and error minimization.\n\n\nOverview of Algorithms:\nThe Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is based on finding a hyperplane that best separates different classes by maximizing the margin between them. If the data is not linearly separable, SVM uses kernel functions to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space, where a linear hyperplane can be found. The decision rule is based on the equation of the hyperplane:\n\\[ f(x) = \\langle w, x \\rangle + b \\]\nwhere w is the weight vector, x is the input feature vector, and b is the bias term.\n\n\n\nTraining and Testing Strategy For SVM\nFirst, we split the data into training set and testing set. We split the dataset into 80% for training and 20% for testing.\n\n# Assuming 'df_svm' contains the relevant features and 'CEO_Gender' is the target variable\nX = df_svm.drop(columns=['GR-B07.EA- Assessment'])\ny = df_svm['GR-B07.EA- Assessment']\n\n# Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=5000)\n\nWe will use Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure balanced distributions of the target variable in each fold.\n\n# Define SVM model\nmodel = SVC()\n\n# Define the parameter grid for hyperparameter tuning\nparam_grid = {\n    'C': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 10],  # Range of values for C (regularization parameter)\n    'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf', 'poly'],  # Selection of kernel types\n    'gamma': ['scale', 'auto'],  # Gamma parameter options\n    'class_weight': [None, 'balanced']  # Whether to use class weights\n}\n\n# Perform GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning\ngrid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy', n_jobs=-1)\ngrid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Output the best parameters\nprint(\"Best Parameters: \", grid_search.best_params_)\n\nBest Parameters:  {'C': 1, 'class_weight': 'balanced', 'gamma': 'scale', 'kernel': 'rbf'}\n\n\n\n\nModel Evaluation Metrics For SVM\nAnd then, we will evaluate the performance.\n\n# Make predictions on the test set\ny_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)\n\n# Calculate binary classification metrics\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprecision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)\nrecall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)\nf1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)\nroc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred)\n\n# Confusion Matrix\ncm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)\n\n# Calculate ROC Curve\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, best_model.decision_function(X_test))\n\n# Print the evaluation metrics\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Precision: {precision:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Recall: {recall:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"F1 Score: {f1:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"ROC-AUC: {roc_auc:.2f}\")\n\nAccuracy: 0.73\nPrecision: 0.79\nRecall: 0.68\nF1 Score: 0.73\nROC-AUC: 0.74\n\n\n\n\nResults For SVM\n\nModel Performance Summary\nThe model’s performance shows that it has a moderate ability to predict whether a firm buys from women-owned businesses based on financial data and the firm’s gender equity rating. The accuracy rate was 0.73, indicating that the model correctly classified 73% of the events. The accuracy is 0.79, indicating that when the model predicts a positive class, the accuracy is 79%. However, the recall rate of 0.68 indicates that the model missed about 32% of the actual positive events. An F1 score of 0.73 implies a trade-off between accuracy and recall, but a ROC-AUC of 0.74 indicates a moderate level of performance for the model in the distinction between the two classes.\n\n\nVisualization\n\nROC Curve\nThe ROC curve shows the model’s ability to distinguish between companies that procure from women-owned businesses and those that do not. The curve is plotted with the false positive rate on the x-axis and the true positive rate on the y-axis.\n\n# Visualize the ROC curve\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='blue', lw=2, label=f'ROC curve (area = {roc_auc:.2f})')\nplt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='gray', lw=2, linestyle='--')\nplt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])\nplt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])\nplt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')\nplt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')\nplt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve')\nplt.legend(loc=\"lower right\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\nThe model performs decently, with an AUC of 0.74, indicating it has a 74% chance of correctly distinguishing between the two classes.\nKey Insights:\nThe model performs better than random guessing (as the curve is above the diagonal), there is still room for improvement in its ability to make accurate predictions.\n\n\nFeature Importance Plot\nThe purpose of plotting the feature importance is to evaluate which features have the most influence on the model’s predictions.\n\n# Feature importance using permutation importance (for SVM, if not linear)\nresult = permutation_importance(best_model, X_test, y_test, n_repeats=10, random_state=42)\nimportances = result.importances_mean\nfeatures = X.columns\n\n# Plot the feature importance\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.title('Feature Importances')\nplt.barh(range(len(features)), importances, align='center')\nplt.yticks(range(len(features)), features)\nplt.xlabel('Mean Importance')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\nThe feature importance plot shows that the “Total” feature, likely representing the company’s overall gender equality score, has the highest importance in predicting whether the company procures from women-owned businesses. Other important features include “RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax (k)” and “ComprehensiveIncomeNetOfTax (k)”, which suggest that financial performance is a significant factor. On the other hand, “OperatingIncomeLoss (k)” and “Assets (k)” have relatively lower importance, indicating that they contribute less to the prediction in this model.\nKey Insights:\nTo be more specific, RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax (k) being an important feature makes sense because it reflects the company’s business activity and economic power. Companies with higher revenues are more likely to have the financial flexibility and resources to engage in initiatives related to gender equality and procurement from women-owned businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression\n\nFeature Selection For Logistic Regression\nFeatures:\nIn the logistic regression model, we selected the following dependent variable:\n‘CEO Gender’: It represents the gender of the company’s CEO and is a binary classification target (male or female).\nWe selected the following independent vairables:\n‘Assets (k)’: Represents the total assets of the company, typically reflecting the size and financial health of the company, which may influence corporate governance structures.\n‘EntityPublicFloat (k)’: The publicly traded share capital of the company, indicating the company’s market performance and the level of public investor interest, which might affect gender balance.\n‘AccountsReceivableNetCurrent (k)’: Represents the company’s net current accounts receivable, showing the company’s financial health.\n‘GL-B01.EA-Assessment’: A binary variable about whether the company maintains a gender balance (between 40-60%) at the highest governance body.\n‘EE-B06.EB-Assessment’: A binary variable about whether the company describes how it supports the practices of its business relationships in relation to freedom of association and collective bargaining.\nObjective:\nBy using logistic regression, we aim to identify the factors that statistically affect the gender of the CEO, treating it as a binary classification task (male vs. female). The goal is to understand how the combination of these financial and policy-related features influences the likelihood of a female CEO being appointed.\n\n\nModel Selection\n\nModel Rationale:\nWe selected logistic regression for analyzing the dependent variable ‘CEO Gender’, which represents whether the CEO of the company is female or male. Logistic regression is commonly used for binary classification problems, it allows us to evaluate how independent variables impact the likelihood of a specific outcome, such as the gender of the CEO.\n\n\nOverview of Algorithms:\nLogistic Regression is a supervised learning model used for binary problems or multiclass problems. It estimates the relationship between input features and the target variable by mapping the linear combination of features to a probability value using a logistic function. Logistic regression offers benefits such as simplicity, ease of interpretation, and efficiency, making it an excellent option for binary outcome problems.\nThe Logistic Regression formula is:\n\\[ P(Y = 1 | X) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + \\cdots + b_nX_n)}} \\]\nWhere: \\(P(Y = 1 | X)\\) is the probability that the outcome (target variable \\(Y\\)) is 1 (e.g., CEO gender is “female”).\n\\(b_0\\) is the intercept (bias term).\n\\(b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n\\) are the coefficients of the input features \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\).\n\\(e\\) is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\n\n\nTraining and Testing Strategy For Logistic Regression\nWe will train the model.\n\n# Define features and target variable\nX = df_lr.drop(columns=['CEO Gender'])\ny = df_lr['CEO Gender']\n\n# Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n\n# Initialize the logistic regression model\nmodel = LogisticRegression()\n\n# Perform 10-Fold Cross-Validation\ncv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=10)\n\n# Output the cross-validation results\nprint(f\"Cross-Validation Scores: {cv_scores}\")\nprint(f\"Mean CV Score: {cv_scores.mean()}\")\n\nCross-Validation Scores: [0.9047619 0.9047619 0.95      0.95      0.95      0.95      0.95\n 0.9       0.9       0.9      ]\nMean CV Score: 0.925952380952381\n\n\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predictions\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n\n\n\nModel Evaluation Metrics For Logistic Regression\nAnd then, we will evaluate the model.\n\n# Accuracy\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy}\")\n\n# Precision\nprecision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(f\"Precision: {precision}\")\n\n# Recall\nrecall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(f\"Recall: {recall}\")\n\n# F1 Score\nf1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(f\"F1 Score: {f1}\")\n\n# ROC-AUC\ny_prob = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]\nroc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_prob)\nprint(f\"ROC-AUC: {roc_auc}\")\n\nAccuracy: 0.8292682926829268\nPrecision: 0.8292682926829268\nRecall: 1.0\nF1 Score: 0.9066666666666667\nROC-AUC: 0.7605042016806723\n\n\n\n\nResults For Logistic Regression\n\nModel Performance Summary:\nThrough model evaluation, we can find that the model has a good performance, with the accuracy of 0.829 and the precision of 0.829. The recall rate is 1.0, which means that the model successfully identified all true positives. The F1 score of 0.907 reflects a good trade-off. The ROC-AUC is 0.761, which means that the model has a moderate ability to distinguish two categories: female and male.\n\n\nVisualizations:\n\nROC Curve\nThe ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) is used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. In this case, it helps assess how well the logistic regression model is able to distinguish between the two classes of the target variable, CEO Gender (male or female), based on the selected features.\n\n# ROC Curve\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_prob)\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='blue', label='ROC Curve (AUC = {:.4f})'.format(roc_auc))\nplt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='gray', linestyle='--')  # Random classifier line\nplt.title('ROC Curve')\nplt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')\nplt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')\nplt.legend(loc='lower right')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\nThe curve is above the diagonal line (random classifier), indicating that the model’s predictions are better than random guessing.\nKey Insights:\nThe model performs relatively well, with an AUC of 0.7605, suggesting that the model has a good ability to distinguish between the two classes.\n\n\nFeature Importance Heatmap\nThe purpose of the plot is to visually represent the contribution of each feature in predicting the likelihood of a company having a female CEO, as indicated by the logistic regression model’s coefficients.\n\n# Get the coefficients from the Logistic Regression model (related to predicting class 1)\ncoefficients = model.coef_[0]  # model.coef_ has the shape (1, n_features)\n\n# Create a DataFrame with the coefficients and corresponding feature names\ncoef_df = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Feature': X.columns,\n    'Coefficient': coefficients  # Retain the signs of coefficients (not using abs)\n})\n\n# Create the figure and adjust the size\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n\n# Plot a heatmap showing the negative coefficients related to female (class 0) or positive coefficients for male (class 1)\nsns.heatmap(coef_df.set_index('Feature').T, annot=False, cmap=\"coolwarm\", cbar=True)\n\n# Add title and description\nplt.title('Feature Contribution to Predicting CEO Gender (0: Female, 1: Male)', fontsize=16)\n\n# Add colorbar label\ncbar = plt.gca().collections[0].colorbar\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\nFrom the heatmap, we observe that several features, particularly “EntityPublicFloat (k)” and “GL-B01.EA-Assessment,” have relatively higher positive coefficients, indicating they are associated with an increased likelihood of having a male CEO. On the other hand, features such as “EE-B06.EB-Assessment” and “Assets (k)” have negative coefficients, suggesting they are more favorable for a female CEO.\nKey Insights:\nFeatures like “Assets (k)” and “EE-B06.EB-Assessment” show negative coefficients, implying that larger company assets and positive gender-related assessments could be factors promoting a female CEO.\nFeatures like “EntityPublicFloat (k)” and “GL-B01.EA-Assessment” have higher positive values, which might indicate that companies with higher public shareholding and better gender balance at the highest governance body tend to have male CEOs.\nThe results could reflect the increasing recognition of the importance of gender equality in leadership. Companies with more assets and progressive labor practices are likely to be at the forefront of social responsibility and diversity initiatives. Larger companies, with their broader resources and visibility, are more likely to appoint women to executive roles, including the position of CEO. Additionally, their commitment to fair labor practices and gender equality could also translate into selecting female leaders who align with their values of equity and inclusivity."

It reflects the company’s governance transparency and its ability to attract public investment.\nGPG-C01.EA-Evidence_Sentiment: This feature captures whether the company collects sex-disaggregated pay data. The sentiment score derived from text analysis reflects the company’s stance on gender pay gap data collection. A positive sentiment would suggest the company actively supports gender equality in pay, while a negative sentiment would suggest the opposite.\nGR-B07.EA-Assessment: This feature indicates whether the company procures from women-owned businesses. Gender-responsive procurement is a critical area of corporate responsibility related to gender equality.\nGL-B01.EA-Assessment: This feature assesses whether the company maintains gender balance (between 40-60%) at the highest governance body, which reflects the company’s commitment to gender equality in leadership positions.\n\n\nModel Selection\n\nModel Rationale:\nThe Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) was chosen because it is very effective at capturing nonlinear relationships and interactions between features and is therefore well suited for prediction of the target variable (Total). GBR combines multiple weak pressures, usually decision trees, to create a strong prediction model. This integrated approach minimizes iteration errors by focusing on the weaknesses of previous iterations, thereby improving overall accuracy. In addition, it works well with combinations of numbers and categorical variables, such as financial metrics and sentiment scores in this dataset.\n\n\nOverview of Algorithms:\nGradient Boosting Regressor works by optimizing a loss function through the iterative addition of decision trees as weak learners. The core algorithm minimizes the loss function L(y,f(x)), where yy is the true target and f(x) is the predicted value. The model uses gradient descent to adjust tree predictions, effectively minimizing errors over iterations.\nThe update rule for Gradient Boosting is as follows:\n1 Initialize the model with a constant prediction:\n\\[ F_0(x) = \\arg\\min_{\\theta} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} L(y_i, \\theta) \\]\nwhere $ ( F_0(x) ) $ is the initial prediction and $ ( L(y_i, ) ) $ is the loss function.\n2 For $ ( m = 1, 2, , M ) $ iterations:\n\nCompute the gradient (pseudo-residuals):\n\n\\[  r_{im} = - \\left[ \\frac{\\partial L(y_i, F(x_i))}{\\partial F(x_i)} \\right]_{F(x) = F_{m-1}(x)} \\]\nwhere $ ( r_{im} ) $ is the residual at the $ ( m ) $-th iteration, and $ ( F_{m-1}(x) ) $ is the model from the previous iteration.\n\nFit a weak learner $ ( h_m(x) ) $ to the residuals $ ( r_{im} )$.\nUpdate the model:\n\\[ F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \\eta \\cdot h_m(x) \\]\nwhere $ ( ) $ is the learning rate, and $ ( h_m(x) ) $ is the weak learner fitted to the residuals.\n\n\n\n\nTraining and Testing Strategy For Gradient Boosting Regression\nThe dataset is divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split.\n\n# Define features and target variable\nX = df_br.drop(columns=['Total'])\ny = df_br['Total']\n\n# Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=5000)\n\n\n# Initialize the GradientBoostingRegressor model with default parameters\nmodel = GradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=5000)\n\n# Train the model with default parameters\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Make predictions with the default model\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n\n\n\nModel Evaluation Metrics For Gradient Boosting Regression\nWe use Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R²) to evaluate the model.\n\n# Calculate evaluation metrics\nmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)\nrmse = mse ** 0.5\nr2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)\n\n# Print the evaluation metrics\nprint(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse:.4f}')\nprint(f'Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse:.4f}')\nprint(f'R-squared: {r2:.4f}')\n\nMean Squared Error: 0.0135\nRoot Mean Squared Error: 0.1160\nR-squared: 0.4435\n\n\nLow MSE and RMSE values indicate good model performance, meaning the model’s predictions are close to the actual values. A higher R² value would be better, but 0.44 indicates the model is explaining about 44.35% of the variance in the data, which can be considered reasonable, though improvements may be possible.\n\n\nResults For Gradient Boosting Regression\n\nModel Performance Summary:\nGBR was trained on how to predict the target variable Total, which represents a company’s gender equality score. We evaluated the model’s performance using three key metrics: the mean square error (MSE) of 0.0135, indicating a relatively low mean square error between the predicted and actual values; The root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.1160, which provides a moderate error measure for the prediction. R²= 0.4435, indicating that the model explains about 44.35% of the variance of the target variable. Although there is still a lot of room for improvement, we can see from the above results that the model captures a large part of the variability in the data, which proves that our model has some validity.\n\n\nVisualizations:\n\nQ-Q plot\nThe Q-Q plot (Quantile-Quantile plot) is used to assess whether the residuals from a regression model follow a normal distribution. In the plot, the blue dots represent the ordered residual values, and the red line is the theoretical quantile line for a normal distribution.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nstats.probplot(residuals, dist=\"norm\", plot=plt)\nplt.title('Q-Q Plot')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\nFrom the Q-Q plot, it can be observed that the residuals are very close to the red line, especially in the middle of the line. This good fit indicates that the residual is approximately normal distribution, which means that our model conforms to the hypothesis of the normal of the residual, which proves the basic validity of our model.\nKey Insights:\nWe can assume that our model has the validity required for the most basic regression models because the residuals are approximately normally distributed.\n\n\nFeature Importance Plot\nThe purpose of plotting the feature importance is to evaluate which features have the most influence on the model’s predictions. This helps us understand the relative importance of each feature and guides further analysis, such as selecting the most important features for future modeling or improving model performance.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nfeature_importances = model.feature_importances_\nfeatures = X.columns\nindices = np.argsort(feature_importances)\n\nplt.barh(range(len(indices)), feature_importances[indices], align='center')\nplt.yticks(range(len(indices)), [features[i] for i in indices])\nplt.xlabel('Feature Importance')\nplt.title('Feature Importance Plot')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\nFrom the feature importance plot, we can see that “GR-B07.EA-Assessment” has the highest importance, followed by “ComprehensiveIncomeNetOfTax (k)” and “EntityPublicFloat (k)”. Other features, such as “GPG-C01.EA-Evidence_Sentiment” and “GL-B01.EA-Assessment”, show lower importance.\nKey Insights:\nThe most important feature is “GR-B07.EA-Assessment,” indicating that the company’s procurement from women-owned businesses is a strong predictor of the target variable, “Total”. Financial features like “ComprehensiveIncomeNetOfTax (k)” and “EntityPublicFloat (k)” also play significant roles. However, features like “GPG-C01.EA-Evidence_Sentiment” and “GL-B01.EA-Assessment” have relatively lower importance, suggesting that their contribution to the model’s prediction is smaller."

We know that this assessment is done manually by reviewing textual evidence, which is very time consuming. By applying supervised learning using random forest classifiers and extracting features from TF-IDF representations of evidence texts, we aim to create an automated, efficient, and objective classification system. This will help streamline the process and expand the evaluation of large data sets, enabling data-driven decisions to be made in combination with gender equality and text data from company reports.\n\n\nModel Selection\n\nModel Rationale:\nThe random forest classifier was chosen for this task because of its robustness in classifying multiple labels. The model reconstructs multiple decision trees during the training process and can finally output a category. This has advantages over simple decision trees because it can help reduce the risk of overfitting and improve generalization. In addition, the model also provides a score of feature importance, which can help us explore which features are most relevant for our label recognition, which is very suitable for working with text data, so we choose a random forest classifier.\n\n\nOverview of Algorithms:\nThe Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning method that builds a multitude of decision trees and merges their outputs to produce a more accurate and stable prediction. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, and only a random subset of features is considered when splitting nodes in each tree, which introduces diversity and improves the model’s performance.\n\n\n\nTraining and Testing Strategy For Random Forest Classifier\nWe split the data, 80% of the data is used for training, and the remaining 20% is reserved for testing.\n\nX = df_rf['HSW-D01.EC-Assessment']\ny = df_rf['HSW-D01.EC-Assessment']\n\n\n# Split data into train and test sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=5000)\n\n# Initialize TF-IDF vectorizer\ntfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')\n\n# Fit and transform the training data\nX_train_tfidf = tfidf.fit_transform(X_train)\n\n# Transform the test data\nX_test_tfidf = tfidf.transform(X_test)\n\n# Initialize the Random Forest classifier\nmodel = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=5000, class_weight='balanced')\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)\n\n# Predict on the test set\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test_tfidf)\n\n\n\nModel Evaluation Metrics For Random Forest Classifier\nWe will generate a confusion matrix and classification report to assess the model’s performance across different classes.\n\n# Evaluate the model\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprecision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro')  # Macro average for multiclass\nrecall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro')  # Macro average for multiclass\nf1_macro = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro')  # Macro average F1 score\nf1_micro = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='micro')  # Micro average F1 score\n\n# Confusion matrix for multiclass classification\nconf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)\n\n# Classification report for detailed metrics per class\nclass_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)\n\n# Print the evaluation results\nprint(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}')\nprint(f'Precision (Macro Average): {precision:.4f}')\nprint(f'Recall (Macro Average): {recall:.4f}')\nprint(f'Macro F1 Score: {f1_macro:.4f}')\nprint(f'Micro F1 Score: {f1_micro:.4f}')\n\n# Print the classification report\nprint('Classification Report:')\nprint(class_report)\n\nAccuracy: 0.6829\nPrecision (Macro Average): 0.3974\nRecall (Macro Average): 0.4604\nMacro F1 Score: 0.3985\nMicro F1 Score: 0.6829\nClassification Report:\n              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n           0       0.96      0.78      0.86        32\n           1       0.00      0.00      0.00         4\n           2       0.23      0.60      0.33         5\n\n    accuracy                           0.68        41\n   macro avg       0.40      0.46      0.40        41\nweighted avg       0.78      0.68      0.71        41\n\n\n\n\n\nResults For Random Forest Classifier\n\nModel Performance Summary:\nThe perfomance is as follows:\nAccuracy: The model achieved 68.29% accuracy, which indicates that it correctly ranked around 68% of instances in all tests.\nPrecision (Macro Average): The macro precision is 39.74%, which means that the model has medium precision when all categories are considered.\nRecall (Macro Average): The macro average recall is 46.04%, indicating that the ability of the model to identify all relevant instances in all classes is moderate.\nF1 score: the gross average of F1 is 39.85%, indicating a balance between accuracy and withdrawal, but overall performance should improve.\nMicro F1 Score: : The average of micro F1 is 68.29%, taking into account the total number of true positives, false positives and false negatives in all classes, which is consistent with accuracy.\n\n\nVisualizations:\nThe purpose of generating this two plots is to visualize the importance of various features in predicting the target variable, which in this case is related to the company’s coverage of health services. This helps to identify which factors are most influential in determining the classification of the company’s health coverage status.\n\n# Get feature importances\nfeature_importances = model.feature_importances_\n\n# Get feature names (for Tfidf, feature names are obtained through get_feature_names_out)\nfeature_names = tfidf.get_feature_names_out()\n\n# Combine feature names and importance into a DataFrame\nfeature_df = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Feature': feature_names,\n    'Importance': feature_importances\n})\n\n# Sort by importance\nfeature_df = feature_df.sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False)\n\n# Plot the bar chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.barplot(x='Importance', y='Feature', data=feature_df.head(20))  # Display the top 20 most important features\nplt.title('Top 20 Feature Importance')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Combine feature names and importance into a dictionary\nfeature_dict = dict(zip(feature_names, feature_importances))\n\n# Generate the word cloud\nwordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate_from_frequencies(feature_dict)\n\n# Plot the word cloud\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')\nplt.axis('off')  # No axes for the word cloud\nplt.title('Feature Importance Word Cloud')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\nWe can find that when evaluating whether these text data meet the criteria for health coverage, “health” is the most important feature, followed by “information”, “coverage” and “employees”. This suggests that these words are important for classification, as they are several important features that affect the model’s predictions.\nKey Insights:\nUsing bar plot and word cloud, we can see that “health” and “information” are the dominant features, suggesting that health coverage and related data are strong predictors.\nFeatures such as “evidence”, “support” and “reproductive” also showed significant importance, indicating that the company’s actions and support in healthcare services, including reproductive health, contributed significantly to the classification.\nLow-level features, such as “assistance” and “associated,” still have some impact, but they are less significant than higher-level features."

    "text": "Result Interpretation:\nAs for SVM, the main research question is to understand how factors like a company’s financial health and revenue affect its decision to buy from women-owned businesses, with the goal of seeing if financial strength influences their support for gender equality in business. From the feature importance plot, we see that the most important factor influencing a company’s decision to buy from women-owned businesses is its gender equality score (Total).\nThe results show that companies committed to gender equality are more likely to support women-owned businesses. Other key factors include the company’s financial health, such as comprehensive income, operating income, and revenue, which also play a significant role in this decision.\nIn addition, the results suggest that companies with better financial health are more likely to support diversity initiatives like procurement from women-owned businesses. Therefore, improving financial stability could be a strategy for companies wanting to boost their gender equity practices. Policymakers may also use these insights to identify companies that align with gender equality goals and direct support or incentives towards them.\nAs for Logistic Regression, we want to understand financial and governance-related factors, company assets, public holdings and so on. We want to know if these factors are related to CEO gender, and we can understand which factors are more important to CEO gender, such as which factors are more positively associated with female CEOs.\nThrough the results of model training, we can find that financial and governance factors do play a very important role in shaping and judging the gender of ceos. Specifically, companies with larger total assets and a stronger commitment to gender equality tend to have female CEOs. On the other hand, companies with higher levels of public ownership and more balanced gender governance are more likely to hire male CEOs. Therefore, female CEOs may be more focused on financial stability, such as holding more assets, male CEOs may be more risky in their financial strategies, and female CEOs may be more focused on gender equality principles.\nAs for Gradient Boosting Regression, we wanted to train the model to identify the key factors that affect the overall gender equality score in the company. More specifically, we selected a number of financial health indicators (e.g. revenue and public shareholding) and gender-related practices (e.g. purchasing from women-owned businesses, gender balance in governance) for which companies were able to obtain higher gender equality scores.\nThe results reveals that several key factors influence a company’s gender equality score. First, companies that procure from women-owned businesses tend to score higher in gender equality, indicating the importance of gender-responsive procurement practices. A company’s financial health, particularly its comprehensive income, also plays a significant role, as companies with better financial performance are more likely to invest in gender equality initiatives. Additionally, companies with a larger public float may face more external pressure on gender equality, contributing to higher scores. Finally, companies that demonstrate a positive sentiment towards addressing the gender pay gap are also more likely to score higher in gender equality, showing that attitudes toward pay equity matter.\nAs for Random Forest Classifier, we focused on understanding how the text evidence provided by a company regarding health coverage affects whether a company meets the criteria for health coverage, particularly for maternal health, sexual and reproductive health. Our original labels have three categories, meet, partially met, and unmet, so the goal is to use the available evidence to predict whether a company meets, partially meets, or does not meet the health insurance criteria, trying to automate this assessment process.\nThese findings have important implications for companies aiming to improve their health coverage offerings. By understanding which factors—such as “Health” and “Coverage”—are most influential, companies can better tailor their services to meet gender-equity and healthcare access standards. Policymakers and advocacy groups can use this information to assess and promote companies that are making significant strides in providing comprehensive health coverage services, ensuring that more businesses align with broader health and gender equality goals."

    "text": "Model Performance Comparison:\nWe compared the performance of four different models—SVM, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and Random Forest, although the research questions we want to explore is quite different, but we use the same dataset.\nSVM showed good results with an accuracy of 73%, precision of 79%, and a relatively balanced recall of 68%, meaning it was able to predict “positive” cases (i.e., correctly identify companies meeting the criteria) but slightly missed some “true positives.”\nLogistic Regression performed the best overall, with the highest accuracy of 83%, perfect recall (1.0), and a strong F1 score of 0.91, meaning it was very effective at identifying both positive and negative cases. The ROC-AUC score (0.76) indicates that the model was able to differentiate between categories reasonably well.\nGradient Boosting Regression is a regression model, so it measures errors in predicting continuous variables. The R-squared value of 0.44 indicates that the model explained about 44% of the variance in the target variable, with a low error (RMSE of 0.12), but it’s not directly comparable to classification models like the others.\nRandom Forest showed decent accuracy (68%) but struggled with precision and recall for some categories, especially for the “1” category, where it performed poorly. The macro-average metrics suggest that it struggles with some of the less frequent classes, but the micro-average F1 score (0.68) indicates it’s reasonably good at overall classification.\nIn conclusion, Logistic Regression performed the best for this classification task, followed by SVM. The Random Forest model had some issues with class imbalance, and the Gradient Boosting Regression wasn’t directly comparable since it’s a regression model, not a classification one."

We also saw that ensemble methods like Random Forest are well-suited for handling complex, multi-dimensional data but may struggle with class imbalances."

    "text": "Challenges\nData Limitations:\n\nGender Equality Scores: The dataset was incomplete for several companies, necessitating extensive cleaning and manual imputations. This introduced potential biases in the analysis.\nCEO Gender Data: Manually collecting CEO gender information was labor-intensive and prone to inaccuracies, especially for companies with less prominent public information.\nFinancial Indicators: Identifying the most relevant financial indicators from the SEC API required comprehensive accounting knowledge and significant preprocessing due to inconsistent data formats and missing fields.\n\nComputational Issues:\n\nHandling large JSON files from the SEC API required optimizing data extraction methods to avoid memory bottlenecks. Python libraries like pandas and json were leveraged, but computational inefficiencies surfaced during merging large datasets.\nDuring machine learning model training (e.g., supervised regression models), feature scaling and dimensionality reduction were crucial to mitigate overfitting and computational delays.\n\nUnexpected Results:\n\nClustering Analysis: Unsupervised methods (e.g., K-Means clustering) did not yield clearly separable groups between high and low-performing companies based on gender diversity metrics. This suggests that the relationship may be non-linear or influenced by confounding factors.\nSupervised Learning: Regression models showed only moderate predictive power for financial performance using gender equality scores and CEO gender as predictors, indicating that additional features or a different modeling approach might be required.\n\nFuture Work:\n\nIncorporating external datasets on company size, industry type, or regional economic indicators could enhance model accuracy.\nAutomating data retrieval processes, particularly for CEO gender and financial metrics, would streamline data updates for scalability.\nApplying advanced non-linear models (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost) or deep learning techniques may better capture complex relationships in the data."

However, the analysis of CEO gender as a variable in conjunction with gender equality scores adds a novel dimension to this research.\nClustering patterns did not strongly align with intuitive expectations, such as high-scoring companies outperforming others financially. This suggests further analysis is needed to explore these relationships with more nuanced metrics.\n\nResearch Alignment:\n\nStudies emphasize the importance of contextual variables like industry and market conditions in explaining diversity-performance linkages. Future iterations of this project could integrate these benchmarks to improve interpretability."

To effectively analyze textual data, several techniques were employed to transform raw text into meaningful features that can be used for classification tasks.\n\nTF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): TF-IDF transforms text into numerical features by evaluating the importance of terms in a document relative to the whole dataset. It helps identify key terms such as “gender balance”, “pay equity”, and “women-owned businesses”, which highlight a company’s commitment to gender equality.\nSentiment Analysis: Sentiment analysis classifies text into positive, neutral, or negative categories to assess a company’s stance on gender equality issues like pay equity or harassment prevention.\nTopic Modeling: Topic modeling uncovers hidden themes in company policies, helping to identify how companies address aspects like pay gap data collection, violence prevention, and gender balance in leadership.\nKeyword and Network Analysis: Keyword analysis identifies frequently discussed topics related to gender equality, while network analysis visualizes relationships between key terms (e.g., “gender equality” and “pay equity”) to understand company policies.\nFeature Engineering: Features derived from sentiment scores, topic distributions, and keyword frequencies are integrated with numerical data to create a comprehensive dataset for machine learning, offering deeper insights into a company’s gender equality practices."

Financial indicators like Net Income, Revenue, and Cash and Cash Equivalents can vary greatly in magnitude. For example: A large company might have billions in revenue, while a smaller company might only have millions. In this case, indicators with larger values may dominate models or visualizations if left unnormalized. By applying Z-Score normalization, all indicators are transformed to a consistent scale where the magnitude of their values is relative to their distribution. This ensures that all features contribute equally to analyses and models, preventing bias from large-scale differences.\n\n# Z-Score Normalization\ndata[financial_columns] = data[financial_columns].apply(\n    lambda x: (x - np.mean(x)) / np.std(x), axis=0\n)\n\nMin-Max Normalization is often applied after Z-Score standardization to scale the data into a specific range. This process is particularly useful when the goal is to standardize the data while preserving its relative differences and ensuring all values are positive. In this case, Min-Max Normalization can also help enhancing the interpretability of the data.\n\n# Min-Max Scaling\nscaler = MinMaxScaler()\ndata[financial_columns] = scaler.fit_transform(data[financial_columns])\n\n\nnum_plots = len(financial_columns)\ncols = 3\nrows = math.ceil(num_plots / cols)\n\n# Histograms for Normalized Financial Indicators - Separate Male/Female\nfor gender in data['CEO Gender'].unique():\n    plt.figure(figsize=(30, 5 * rows))\n    for i, col in enumerate(financial_columns, start=1):\n        plt.subplot(rows, cols, i)\n        sns.histplot(\n            data=data[data['CEO Gender'] == gender],\n            x=col,\n            kde=True,\n            alpha=0.6,\n            bins=20,\n            color='blue' if gender == 'Male' else 'orange'\n        )\n        plt.title(f\"{gender}: Histogram of {col}\")\n        plt.xlabel(col)\n        plt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\n\nOverall Data Range:\n\n\nFor companies with Male CEOs, the financial indicators span a much wider range, with a significant concentration near the lower values, but some extreme high outliers are visible. This suggests a diverse performance range, where a few companies dominate with high financial metrics.\nIn contrast, companies with Female CEOs have a much narrower range for most financial indicators, with data clustered tightly around lower to mid-range values. This indicates less variability and generally lower financial performance metrics.\n\n\nSpecific Indicators:\n\n\nNet Income and Operating Income: Male-led companies show higher peaks near lower values but also have long tails extending toward higher financial performance. Female-led companies’ distributions are narrower and concentrated, with no significant high outliers.\nRevenue and Gross Profit: Similar patterns emerge, with male-led companies exhibiting broader ranges and higher maximum values compared to female-led companies.\nAllocated Share-Based Compensation: Male-led companies show long-tailed distributions, while female-led companies’ distributions are tightly packed, with values concentrated at lower levels.\n\n\nKDE Trends:\n\n\nThe kernel density estimates (KDE) for Male CEOs show smoother, more continuous distributions, reflecting a broad variation.\nThe KDE for Female CEOs is more irregular, indicating fewer data points and clustering around mid-range values.\n\nKey Insights:\n\nVariability in Financial Indicators:\n\n\nMale-led companies show greater variability across all financial indicators, likely reflecting a larger sample size and broader representation of performance levels.\nFemale-led companies exhibit more homogeneity, with fewer extreme values and narrower performance ranges.\n\n\nPotential Underrepresentation:\n\n\nThe tighter distributions for Female CEOs might reflect both underrepresentation in the dataset and structural barriers limiting their opportunities to lead larger or high-performing companies.\n\n\nOutliers in Male-led Companies:\n\n\nThe presence of significant outliers for Male CEOs skews the distribution, suggesting that high-performing companies disproportionately drive the observed patterns.\n\n\n# Box Plots for Normalized Financial Indicators - Separate Male/Female\nfor gender in data['CEO Gender'].unique():\n    plt.figure(figsize=(30, 5 * rows))\n    for i, col in enumerate(financial_columns, start=1):\n        plt.subplot(rows, cols, i)\n        sns.boxplot(\n            data=data[data['CEO Gender'] == gender],\n            x='CEO Gender',\n            y=col,\n            color='blue' if gender == 'Male' else 'orange'\n        )\n        plt.title(f\"{gender}: Box Plot of {col}\")\n        plt.xlabel(\"CEO Gender\")\n        plt.ylabel(\"Normalized Value\")\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\n\nOverall Data Spread and Outliers:\n\n\nFor companies with Male CEOs, the financial indicators exhibit a wider spread and numerous outliers, indicating greater variability and the presence of high-performing companies.\nIn contrast, for companies with Female CEOs, the financial indicators show a much tighter interquartile range (IQR) with fewer or no extreme outliers, suggesting more consistent and narrower performance levels.\n\n\nSpecific Indicators:\n\n\nNet Income and Operating Income: Male-led companies have significantly more outliers extending to higher values, reflecting a small subset of companies with extraordinary financial performance. Female-led companies’ distributions are compact, with median values centered closer to lower ranges.\nRevenue and Gross Profit: Similar to income metrics, male-led companies demonstrate greater dispersion, with outliers pulling the upper bounds of the box plots far higher. Female-led companies maintain a more uniform range of values, with medians skewed toward the lower end.\nAllocated Share-Based Compensation: Male-led companies have extreme values influencing the distribution significantly, whereas female-led companies remain tightly grouped.\n\n\nMedian Comparison:\n\n\nAcross most financial indicators, the medians for male-led companies are higher than those for female-led companies, reflecting potentially higher overall performance metrics for male-led companies in this dataset.\nHowever, the consistent range and central tendency for female-led companies suggest stability and less variability.\n\n\nPresence of Outliers:\n\n\nMale-led companies display more frequent and extreme outliers in nearly every financial indicator, highlighting the presence of a small subset of exceptionally high-performing companies.\nFemale-led companies show fewer or no significant outliers, indicating more clustered performance around the median.\n\nKey Insights:\n\nThe broader ranges and higher outliers for male-led companies suggest greater access to opportunities or larger-scale operations.\nFemale-led companies may operate under constraints, as reflected in their tighter distributions and lower upper bounds.\n\n\n# Statistical Testing\nstat_results = []\nfor col in financial_columns:\n\n    male_values = data[data['CEO Gender'] == 'Male'][col].dropna()\n    female_values = data[data['CEO Gender'] == 'Female'][col].dropna()\n    \n    t_stat, t_pvalue = ttest_ind(male_values, female_values, equal_var=False, nan_policy='omit')\n    \n    stat_results.append({\n        'Indicator': col,\n        'T-Test p-value': t_pvalue\n    })\n\n# Create a DataFrame to summarize test results\nresults_df = pd.DataFrame(stat_results)\n\n# Display the results\nprint(results_df)\n\n                                           Indicator  T-Test p-value\n0                                  NetIncomeLoss (k)        0.092989\n1                            OperatingIncomeLoss (k)        0.244203\n2                                    GrossProfit (k)        0.016878\n3                    ComprehensiveIncomeNetOfTax (k)        0.097709\n4                              EarningsPerShareBasic        0.327595\n5  RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssess...        0.006722\n6                              EntityPublicFloat (k)        0.091844\n7         AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense (k)        0.003232\n8          CashAndCashEquivalentsAtCarryingValue (k)        0.883309\n9                   AccountsReceivableNetCurrent (k)        0.038959\n\n\nHypotheses:\nFor each financial indicator:\n\nNull Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the mean of this financial indicator between male- and female-led companies.\nAlternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in the mean of this financial indicator between male- and female-led companies.\n\nSignificance Level:\nThe significance level (α) is set to 0.05.

And we use wordcload plots and bar plots to visualize the results.\n\n# Keyword extraction\ndef extract_keywords(text_series):\n    vectorizer = CountVectorizer(max_features=20)\n    X = vectorizer.fit_transform(text_series)\n    keywords = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\n    frequencies = X.toarray().sum(axis=0)\n    return dict(zip(keywords, frequencies))\n\n# Extract keywords from explanations\nworkplace_keywords = extract_keywords(workplace_df['GPG-C01.EA-Evidence'].dropna())\nsupply_chain_keywords = extract_keywords(supply_chain_df['CAP-A07.EA-Evidence'].dropna())\n\n\n# Visualization\ndef plot_wordcloud(keyword_dict, title):\n    wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate_from_frequencies(keyword_dict)\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\n    plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')\n    plt.title(title, fontsize=16)\n    plt.axis('off')\n    plt.show()\n\n\n# Wordcloud for supply chain\nplot_wordcloud(supply_chain_keywords, \"Supply Chain Keywords\")\n\n# Wordcloud for workplace\nplot_wordcloud(workplace_keywords, \"Workplace Keywords\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#  Bar plot visualization\ndef plot_bar_chart(keyword_dict, title):\n    # Sort the keywords by frequency in descending order\n    sorted_keywords = sorted(keyword_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n    keywords = [item[0] for item in sorted_keywords]\n    frequencies = [item[1] for item in sorted_keywords]\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\n    plt.barh(keywords, frequencies, color='skyblue')\n    plt.title(title, fontsize=16)\n    plt.xlabel(\"Frequency\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Keywords\")\n    plt.gca().invert_yaxis()\n    plt.show()\n\n\n# Bar chart for workplace\nplot_bar_chart(workplace_keywords, \"Top Keywords in Workplace Explanations\")\n\n# Bar chart for supply chain\nplot_bar_chart(supply_chain_keywords, \"Top Keywords in Supply Chain Explanations\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\nThe keywords in workplace explanations includes “pay”, “compensation”, “global” and “equity”. In contrast, supply chain explanations highlight terms like “suppliers”, “workers”, “status” and “compliance”.\nKey Insights:\nWe can find that workplace text evidence mainly focuses on policies for accountability and equity. In contrast, supply chain text evidence focuses on action, compliance, addressing operational challenges, and resolving gender-related issues. This distinction shows that workplace efforts are primarily policy-driven, while supply chain efforts prioritize actionable measures.\n\n\nSentiment Analysis: Focus on Violence and Harassment Prevention\nTo better apply sentiment analysis, we select following variables:\nVHP-E01.EA-Evidence: Evidence of the company has publicly available policies in place regarding violence and harassment in the workplace (e.g., zero tolerance policy, safe transport policy, etc.).\nWe filtered the words ‘violence’ and ‘harassment’ to avoid their inherently negative sentiment.\n\n# Initialize sentiment analyzer\nanalyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n\n\nfiltered_df = data[data['VHP-E01.EA-Evidence-has_evidence'] == 1]\n\n# Extract explanation text\ncombined_text = filtered_df['VHP-E01.EA-Evidence'].fillna('').apply(lambda x: ' '.join(x) if isinstance(x, list) else x)\n\n# Remove \"harassment\" and \"violence\" from combined_text\ncombined_text = filtered_df['VHP-E01.EA-Evidence'].fillna('').apply(\n    lambda x: re.sub(r'\\b(harassment|violence)\\b', '', x, flags=re.IGNORECASE) if isinstance(x, str) else x\n)\n\n\n# Perform sentiment analysis\ndef analyze_sentiment(text_data):\n    sentiments = []\n    for text in text_data:\n        if pd.notna(text):\n            score = analyzer.polarity_scores(text)\n            sentiments.append(score['compound'])  # Compound sentiment score\n        else:\n            sentiments.append(0)  # Neutral for missing text\n    return sentiments\n\nNext, we analyze sentiment for text and categorize them, After that, we visualize the results.\n\n# Analyze sentiment\nsentiment_scores = analyze_sentiment(combined_text)\n\n\n# Categorize sentiment\ndef categorize_sentiments(sentiment_scores):\n    categories = []\n    for score in sentiment_scores:\n        if score &gt; 0:\n            categories.append('Positive')\n        elif score &lt; 0:\n            categories.append('Negative')\n        else:\n            categories.append('Neutral')\n    return categories\n\n\n# Categorize sentiment\nsentiment_categories = categorize_sentiments(sentiment_scores)\n\n\n# Visualization\ndef plot_sentiment_distribution(sentiment_categories, title):\n    sentiment_counts = pd.Series(sentiment_categories).value_counts()\n    sentiment_counts.plot(kind='bar', color=['green', 'gray', 'red'], figsize=(8, 5))\n    plt.title(title)\n    plt.xlabel('Sentiment Category')\n    plt.ylabel('Count')\n    plt.show()\n\n\n# Visualize results\nplot_sentiment_distribution(sentiment_categories, 'Sentiment Distribution in Supply Chain Explanations')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\nThe sentiment distribution predominantly shows positive entries, with fewer negative and very few neutral sentiments.\nKey Insights:\nWe can find most texts are positive. This suggests an emphasis on proactive measures and commitment to addressing sensitive issues constructively. Negative sentiments of a few companies may reflect acknowledgment of challenges or areas requiring improvement. After analysis, we can find that for a heavy topic, such as Violence and Harassment, most companies need to emphasis on responsibility and accountability in the text, and show their positive attitude.\n\n\nTopic Distribution Across Industries: Gender-responsive human rights due diligence process\nTo better prepare for topic modeling, we select following variables:\nGDD-A04.EA-Evidence: Evidence of the company discloses what gender-related human rights impacts it has assessed and prioritised as being salient (i.e. most severe and potentially irremediable if not addressed).\nWe choose this variable to analyze because we want to learn more about how different industries prioritize and address specific aspects of human rights and supply chain challenges.\nWe tokenize and filter the data first.\n\ndef preprocess_text(text_data):\n    # Tokenize the text (splitting into words)\n    tokenized_text = word_tokenize(text_data.lower())  # Convert to lowercase to standardize\n    \n    # Remove punctuation (if necessary)\n    tokenized_text = [word for word in tokenized_text if word not in string.punctuation]\n    \n    # Return the cleaned tokenized text\n    return tokenized_text\n\n# Filter data based on evidence\nrights_df = data[data['GDD-A04.EA-Evidence-has_evidence'] == 1]\n\n# Group data by 'Industry'\nindustry_grouped_df = rights_df.groupby('Industry')['GDD-A04.EA-Evidence'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join(x)).reset_index()\n\n\n# Preprocess text data for each industry\nindustry_grouped_df['ProcessedText'] = industry_grouped_df['GDD-A04.EA-Evidence'].apply(preprocess_text)\n\n\n# Join tokenized text into a single string for each row\nindustry_grouped_df['ProcessedTextStr'] = industry_grouped_df['ProcessedText'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join(x))\n\nNext, we choose the optimal number of topics and run the modeling.\n\n# Vectorizer\nvectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')\nX = vectorizer.fit_transform(industry_grouped_df['ProcessedTextStr'])\n\n# Function to compute perplexity\ndef compute_perplexity(lda_model, X):\n    return lda_model.perplexity(X)\n\n# List to store perplexity scores\nperplexities = []\ntopic_range = range(2, 11)  # Try 2 to 10 topics\n\n# Train LDA and compute perplexity for different topic numbers\nfor n_topics in topic_range:\n    lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=n_topics, random_state=5000)\n    lda.fit(X)\n    \n    # Compute perplexity (lower is better)\n    perplexity = compute_perplexity(lda, X)\n    perplexities.append(perplexity)\n\noptimal_num_topics = topic_range[np.argmin(perplexities)]\n\n\n# Train the LDA model with the optimal number of topics\nlda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=optimal_num_topics, random_state=5000) \nlda.fit(X)\n\n# Output the topics\nfor index, topic in enumerate(lda.components_):\n    print(f\"Topic #{index}:\")\n    print([vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()[i] for i in topic.argsort()[:-11:-1]])\n\nTopic #0:\n['human', 'factory', 'factories', 'conduct', 'trafficking', 'chain', 'supply', 'act', 'webpage', 'forced']\nTopic #1:\n['rights', 'human', 'risks', 'risk', 'suppliers', 'business', 'report', '2021', 'assessment', 'including']\n\n\nWe using stacked bar chart to analyze the distribution of topics accross industries.\n\n# Get the topic distribution for each document\ntopic_distribution = lda.transform(X)\n\n# Add the topic distribution to the dataframe (one column per topic)\ntopic_columns = [f\"Topic_{i}\" for i in range(optimal_num_topics)]\ntopic_distribution_df = pd.DataFrame(topic_distribution, columns=topic_columns)\n\n# Ensure industry_grouped_df and topic_distribution_df have the same number of rows\n# Reset the index for both DataFrames to ensure they align\nindustry_grouped_df = industry_grouped_df.reset_index(drop=True)  # Reset index to align\ntopic_distribution_df = pd.DataFrame(topic_distribution, columns=topic_columns)\n\n# Double-check the number of rows before concatenating\nassert len(industry_grouped_df) == len(topic_distribution_df), \"Row numbers don't match!\"\n\n# Combine the dataframes\ndf_with_topics = pd.concat([industry_grouped_df, topic_distribution_df], axis=1)\n\n# Aggregate topic distributions by industry\nindustry_topic_dist = df_with_topics.groupby('Industry')[topic_columns].mean()\n\n# Plot the topic distributions across industries (stacked bar chart)\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nindustry_topic_dist.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, figsize=(12, 7), colormap='Set3')\nplt.title('Topic Distribution Across Industries')\nplt.xlabel('Industry')\nplt.ylabel('Topic Proportion')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')\nplt.legend(title='Topics', bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n&lt;Figure size 1000x600 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\nTopic #0, related to supply chain issues and human trafficking, is most relevant to manufacturing, retail, and wholesale industries. Topic #1, focusing on human rights assessments and risk reporting, shows a more balanced distribution across industries, highlighting its relevance in broader corporate governance.\nKey Insights:\nTopic #0, which addresses supply chain issues like forced labor and trafficking, is more significant in industries such as manufacturing and retail, where these issues are more likely to arise. Topic #1, focused on human rights reporting and risk assessment, is more evenly distributed across industries, reflecting the growing importance of human rights evaluation in corporate governance across sectors.\n\n\nKeyword Network Analysis: Unveiling the Structure of Grievance Mechanisms\nTo better prepare for network analysis, we select following variables about grievance mechanisms:\nGM-A05.EA-Evidence: Evidence of the company has a gender-responsive mechanism through which employees can report grievances.\nGM-A05.EA-Evidence: Evidence of the company has one or more channel(s)/mechanism(s), or participates in a shared mechanism, accessible to all external individuals and communities who may be adversely impacted by the company (or individuals or organisations acting on their behalf or who are otherwise in a position to be aware of adverse impacts), to raise complaints or concerns.\nGM-A05.EC-Evidence: Evidence of the company collects, analyses and monitors sex-disaggregated grievance data (e.g. number of grievances reported, number of grievances remediated).\nFirst, combined evidence columns into a single text column.\n\n# Filter data for rows with evidence for all three variables\nfiltered_df = data[\n    (data['GM-A05.EA-Evidence-has_evidence'] == 1) |\n    (data['GM-A05.EB-Evidence-has_evidence'] == 1) |\n    (data['GM-A05.EC-Evidence-has_evidence'] == 1)\n][['GM-A05.EA-Evidence', 'GM-A05.EA-Evidence', 'GM-A05.EC-Evidence']]\n\n# Drop rows where all three evidence fields are NaN (no data available for any variable)\nfiltered_df = filtered_df.dropna(how='all', subset=['GM-A05.EA-Evidence', 'GM-A05.EB-Evidence', 'GM-A05.EC-Evidence'])\n\nNext, computed a co-occurrence matrix by multiplying the term-document matrix with its transpose, and then visualize them.\n\n# Combine evidence columns into a single text column\nfiltered_df['CombinedText'] = filtered_df['GM-A05.EA-Evidence'].fillna('') + ' ' + \\\n                              filtered_df['GM-A05.EB-Evidence'].fillna('') + ' ' + \\\n                              filtered_df['GM-A05.EC-Evidence'].fillna('')\n\n# Tokenize and extract keywords using CountVectorizer\nvectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_features=50)  # Adjust max_features as needed\nX = vectorizer.fit_transform(filtered_df['CombinedText'])\n\n# Get feature names (keywords)\nkeywords = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\n\n# Construct a co-occurrence matrix\ncooccurrence_matrix = (X.T @ X).toarray()  # Multiply term-document matrix by its transpose\ncooccurrence_df = pd.DataFrame(cooccurrence_matrix, index=keywords, columns=keywords)\n\n# Create a NetworkX graph\nG = nx.Graph()\n\n# Add nodes and edges from the co-occurrence matrix\nfor i, word in enumerate(keywords):\n    for j, cooc in enumerate(cooccurrence_matrix[i]):\n        if i != j and cooc &gt; 0:  # Exclude self-loops\n            G.add_edge(keywords[i], keywords[j], weight=cooc)\n\n# Visualization of the network\nplt.figure(figsize=(20, 20))\n\n\n# Use spring layout with adjusted spacing\npos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=5000, k=0.2)\n\n# Draw nodes with adjusted size and color\nnx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, node_size=1000, node_color='skyblue', alpha=0.9)\n\n# Draw edges with transparency based on weight\nedges = nx.draw_networkx_edges(\n    G, pos, \n    edge_color='gray',\n    alpha=0.5, \n    width=[d['weight'] / 20 for (u, v, d) in G.edges(data=True)]\n)\n\n# Add labels with adjusted font size\nnx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos, font_size=10, font_color='black')\n\n# Add title and adjust layout\nplt.title(\"Keyword Co-occurrence Network (Improved Visualization)\", fontsize=16)\nplt.axis('off')  # Turn off axis\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\nThe network highlights strong connections between keywords like “complaint,” “grievance,” “report,” and “rights,” showing their central role in grievance mechanisms. Terms such as “procedure” and “access” suggest a focus on process and accessibility, while some isolated keywords point to less frequent but relevant topics.\nKey Insights:\nGrievance mechanisms are closely tied to reporting rights violations and ensuring accessible procedures. The emphasis on “procedure” and “access” reflects a priority on usability, fairness and formation, while less frequent terms hint at more specialized concerns or contexts.\n\n\nCEO Gender-based Word Frequency Analysis in Gender Strategic Action\nWe select variable about gender strategic action as follow:\nSA-A01.EA-Evidence: Evidence of the company made a public commitment to gender equality and women’s empowerment (e.g. signatory to the UN Women’s Empowerment Principles, or having made another public commitment at CEO level).\nCEO Gender: Gender of CEO.\nWe xompute the frequency of each term for both male and female CEOs, and then normalize the word frequencies to account for different document lengths and biases (e.g., more male CEOs).\n\nstrategic_df = data[data['SA-A01.EA-Evidence-has_evidence'] == 1]\ndf_male_ceo = strategic_df[strategic_df['CEO Gender'] == 'Male']\ndf_female_ceo = strategic_df[strategic_df['CEO Gender'] == 'Female']\ndf_male_ceo = df_male_ceo.dropna(subset=['SA-A01.EA-Evidence'])\ndf_female_ceo = df_female_ceo.dropna(subset=['SA-A01.EA-Evidence'])\n\n\n# List of words to remove\nwords_to_remove = ['2021', '2022', 'women', 'gender','2023']\n\n# Use CountVectorizer to extract word frequencies\nvectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')\n\n# Extract word frequencies for male CEO data\nX_male = vectorizer.fit_transform(df_male_ceo['SA-A01.EA-Evidence'])\n\n# Extract word frequencies for female CEO data (using the same vocabulary as male CEO data)\nX_female = vectorizer.transform(df_female_ceo['SA-A01.EA-Evidence'])\n\n# Get the list of all words in the vocabulary\nwords = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\n\n# Remove the specified words from the vocabulary\nwords = [word for word in words if word not in words_to_remove]\n\n# Re-apply the vectorizer on male and female CEO data using the filtered vocabulary\nX_male_filtered = X_male[:, [vectorizer.get_feature_names_out().tolist().index(word) for word in words]]\nX_female_filtered = X_female[:, [vectorizer.get_feature_names_out().tolist().index(word) for word in words]]\n\n# Calculate the total count of each word in the male CEO documents (filtered vocabulary)\nmale_word_count = X_male_filtered.sum(axis=0).A1  # Convert the word count matrix to a 1D array\n\n# Calculate the total count of each word in the female CEO documents (filtered vocabulary)\nfemale_word_count = X_female_filtered.sum(axis=0).A1\n\n# Calculate the total word count for each male CEO document\nmale_doc_lengths = X_male.sum(axis=1).A1  # Total word count for each male CEO document\n\n# Calculate the total word count for each female CEO document\nfemale_doc_lengths = X_female.sum(axis=1).A1  # Total word count for each female CEO document\n\n# Calculate the normalized word frequency ratio for male CEOs\nmale_word_freq_ratio = male_word_count / male_doc_lengths.sum()\n\n# Calculate the normalized word frequency ratio for female CEOs\nfemale_word_freq_ratio = female_word_count / female_doc_lengths.sum()\n\n# Create a DataFrame to store the word frequencies and ratios for both male and female CEOs\nword_frequencies_df = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Word': words,\n    'Male_Frequency_Ratio': male_word_freq_ratio,\n    'Female_Frequency_Ratio': female_word_freq_ratio\n})\n\n# Sort the DataFrame by Male_Frequency_Ratio in descending order to see the most frequent words\nword_frequencies_df = word_frequencies_df.sort_values(by='Male_Frequency_Ratio', ascending=False)\n\nNext, we visualize them by wordcloud.\n\n# Generate word clouds by combining word frequencies for male and female CEOs\nwordcloud_male = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate_from_frequencies(dict(zip(words, male_word_count)))\nwordcloud_female = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate_from_frequencies(dict(zip(words, female_word_count)))\n\n# Plot the word clouds\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n\n# Word cloud for Male CEOs\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nplt.imshow(wordcloud_male, interpolation='bilinear')\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.title('Word Cloud for Male CEO')\n\n# Word cloud for Female CEOs\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nplt.imshow(wordcloud_female, interpolation='bilinear')\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.title('Word Cloud for Female CEO')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\nThe word clouds display the most frequent terms associated with strategic actions from male-led and female-led companies. In the male CEO group, terms like “leadership”, “business”, “diversity”, and “program” appear larger, indicating higher frequencies. In contrast, the female CEO group highlights terms such as “gender”, “leadership”, “sustainability”, and “diversity”, suggesting a more gender-focused discourse in their strategic actions.\nKey Insights:\nMale CEOs tend to focus on business-related terms like “leadership”, “program”, and “business”.\nFemale CEOs, on the other hand, emphasize gender and sustainability-related terms like “gender”, “leadership”, and “sustainability”, showing a more gender-conscious approach.\nBoth groups highlight “leadership”, but male CEOs seem to focus more on business leadership, while female CEOs connect it to diversity and sustainability.\n\n\nAnalysis of Pay Gap Data Collection Based on CEO Gender\nWe found that the word “pay” mentioned more in the evidence of strategy in companies which CEO is female, so we want to check that if female company have a better standard of pay gap. So we select variable as follow:\nGPG-C01.EB-Assessment: Whether the company collects sex-disaggregated pay data by different pay bands, occupational functions, or other financial benefits or not.\nCEO Gender: Gender of CEO.\nWe first try to clean and transform the GPG-C01.EB-Assessment values into binary categories, and then calculate the percentage of “Met” and “Unmet” for each CEO gender using div(). After that, we analyze the results and draw conclusions about the relationship between CEO gender and the company’s ability to meet pay gap data collection standards.\n\ndf = data[['CEO Gender', 'GPG-C01.EB-Assessment']].copy()  # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original DataFrame\n\n# Use .loc to avoid SettingWithCopyWarning\ndf.loc[:, 'C01.EB_BINARY'] = df['GPG-C01.EB-Assessment'].map({'Met': 1, 'Unmet': 0})\n\n# Create a contingency table (cross-tabulation)\ncross_tab = pd.crosstab(df['CEO Gender'], df['C01.EB_BINARY'])\n\n# Calculate the percentage of 'Met' and 'Unmet' for each CEO Gender\ncross_tab_percentage = cross_tab.div(cross_tab.sum(axis=1), axis=0) * 100\n\n# Plot a stacked bar chart\ncross_tab_percentage.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, figsize=(8, 6), color=['lightblue', 'orange'])\n\n# Add title and labels\nplt.title('Pay Gap Data Collection by CEO Gender')\nplt.xlabel('CEO Gender')\nplt.ylabel('Percentage (%)')\nplt.xticks(rotation=0)\nplt.legend(['Unmet', 'Met'], title='Assessment')\n\n# Adjust layout to ensure the chart is displayed properly\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Observations:\nMale CEOs: No companies led by male CEOs do not meet the standards for collecting pay gap data.\nFemale CEOs: More companies led by female CEOs have met the standards.\nKey Insights:\nFemale-led companies are more likely to meet pay gap data collection standards.Male-led companies show a higher proportion of “Unmet,” indicating there may be more work needed in these organizations to meet gender equity standards."

    "text": "Summary of EDA Findings\nUnivariate Analysis\nThe univariate analysis for gender-related data suggests that most companies performed extremely poorly in gender equality measures. The underrepresentation of women in leadership roles, combined with the low gender equality scores, points to systemic issues within these organizations.\nThe findings reveal a pressing need for companies to make substantial improvements in gender equality, particularly at the leadership level. The data underscores the lack of significant gender diversity in CEO positions and highlights that achieving high gender equality standards is rare among the companies studied.\nBivariate and Multivariate Analysis\nThe tighter distributions for female-led companies may reflect both their underrepresentation in the dataset and potential structural barriers limiting their opportunities to lead high-performing companies.\nGross profit, allocated share-based compensation, and accounts receivable show strong relationships with Total Score, indicating that gender-equal companies tend to be more profitable, invest in employees, and have better operational reach. Total Score also shows moderate relationships with net income and comprehensive income, but weak or no relationships with revenue and EPS.\nThe analysis highlights that promoting gender equality in companies is not only a social imperative but may also contribute to improved financial performance, particularly in operational metrics. However, its impact on revenue and shareholder returns is less clear, suggesting that other factors may play a more direct role in driving these outcomes.\nText Analysis and Feature Engineering\nAs for the text data, the EDA reveals trends in reporting gender equality measures in companies. We can see from keyword analysis that workplace-related texts focus primarily on policies for equity and accountability, while supply chain texts emphasize actionable measures such as compliance and operational challenges. Sentiment analysis, however, shows that positive emotions dominate some of the heavier topics, such as violence and harassment, underscoring positive efforts towards gender equality.\nThematic modelling suggests that the topic of human rights assessment is more evenly distributed across sectors. Keyword network analysis reveals that in the grievance mechanism, terms such as “complaint” and “right” are central. In addition, analysis of CEO gender and strategic actions shows that male-led companies are more focused on business leadership, while female-led companies emphasize gender equality and sustainability in their strategic approach. At the same time, few companies with male CEOs mentioned promoting the gender pay gap in their reports."

These techniques are particularly useful when we aim to discover intrinsic patterns, such as how certain corporate characteristics correlate with higher gender equality scores or financial success.\nIn this study, we aim to use unsupervised learning methods to uncover underlying patterns within the dataset of companies’ financial indicators and gender equality measures. By clustering companies based on these characteristics, we can identify different groups of companies that exhibit similar profiles in terms of gender equality, leadership diversity, and financial performance. The insights from these clusters can help uncover systemic barriers, trends, or areas for potential improvement in corporate governance and inclusivity practices.\nBy leveraging unsupervised learning techniques, we aim to:\n\nReveal patterns in corporate behavior related to gender equality.\nExplore the association between financial performance and diversity metrics.\nIdentify outliers or high-performing companies that demonstrate exceptional gender equality practices.\n\nThis section will focus on how unsupervised learning models, such as clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques, were applied to analyze company performance and gender equality."

components (PC1 and PC2) derived from their Assessment Variables (e.g., workplace practices, compensation, prevention of harassment). The color gradient represents the Total Score, with blue indicating lower scores and red indicating higher scores.\nVisual Observations:\n\nSpread Along Principal Component 1 (PC1):\n\n\nThe horizontal axis (PC1) accounts for the largest proportion of variance in the assessment data.\nCompanies on the right (positive PC1 values) tend to have higher Total Scores (red points), while companies on the left (negative PC1 values) generally have lower Total Scores (blue points).\nThis indicates that PC1 captures a primary dimension of performance across the assessments, with higher values representing better alignment with gender equality standards.\n\n\nSpread Along Principal Component 2 (PC2):\n\n\nThe vertical axis (PC2) captures the second-largest proportion of variance, showing additional dimensions of differentiation in company performance.\nThere is no clear trend between PC2 values and Total Score, suggesting that PC2 may represent secondary characteristics or a more nuanced aspect of compliance with assessment standards.\n\n\nClusters and Patterns:\n\n\nCompanies with similar Total Scores tend to cluster together along PC1. For example: High-scoring companies (Total Score &gt; 15) are more concentrated on the right side of the plot. Low-scoring companies (Total Score &lt; 5) are more prevalent on the left.\nHowever, there is some overlap between mid-range scoring companies (light blue to gray), suggesting that certain Assessment Variables may not fully differentiate these companies.\n\nKey Insights:\n\nPC1 as a Key Driver of Total Score:\n\n\nThe strong alignment between PC1 and Total Score suggests that this component captures the primary dimension of compliance with gender equality standards.\nHigh PC1 values likely reflect better overall performance across most assessment dimensions.\n\n\nPC2 Adds Secondary Differentiation:\n\n\nPC2 does not correlate strongly with Total Score but may represent nuanced differences in how companies approach specific dimensions of gender equality.\n\n\nClustering of High- and Low-Scoring Companies:\n\n\nCompanies with high Total Scores are more clearly separated along PC1, indicating stronger compliance across multiple assessment dimensions.\nLow-scoring companies are concentrated in the negative PC1 region, reflecting widespread non-compliance or unmet standards.\n\n\n# Apply t-SNE\ntsne_assessment = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)\ntsne_assessment_result = tsne_assessment.fit_transform(assessment_data_scaled)\n\n# Visualize t-SNE results\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\nplt.scatter(tsne_assessment_result[:, 0], tsne_assessment_result[:, 1], c=data_cleaned_assessment['Total'], cmap='coolwarm', alpha=0.7)\nplt.title('t-SNE: Assessment Variables and Total Score')\nplt.xlabel('Dimension 1')\nplt.ylabel('Dimension 2')\nplt.colorbar(label='Total Score')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis t-SNE plot visualizes the distribution of companies based on their Assessment Variables, with Total Score represented by the color gradient. Blue points indicate companies with lower Total Scores, while red points represent companies with higher Total Scores.\nUnlike PCA, t-SNE focuses on preserving the local relationships in the data, capturing potential non-linear patterns that might not be visible with linear dimensionality reduction methods.\nVisual Observations: 1. Clustering Patterns:\n\nCompanies with similar Total Scores tend to cluster together, indicating that certain groups of companies share common assessment profiles.\nFor example: Low-scoring companies (blue) tend to form clusters in the left-hand side of the plot (e.g., Dimension 1 &lt; -4). High-scoring companies (red) are more dispersed but tend to occupy distinct positions toward the right-hand side (Dimension 1 &gt; 0).\n\n\nSeparation by Total Score:\n\n\nThere is a clear separation between low-scoring and high-scoring companies along Dimension 1.\nCompanies with high Total Scores appear less clustered and more dispersed, potentially reflecting greater diversity in their compliance with different assessment dimensions.\n\n\nOverlapping Mid-Range Scores:\n\n\nCompanies with mid-range Total Scores (light blue to gray) show significant overlap across the plot.\nThis indicates that mid-range performers may not exhibit distinctive patterns in their assessment profiles, or their scores might be influenced by a balanced mix of “Met” and “Unmet” assessments across dimensions.\n\nKey Insights: 1. Assessment Variables as Drivers of Total Score:\n\nThe clustering of companies by Total Score suggests that the Assessment Variables collectively determine performance.\nHigh-scoring companies are distinctly separated from low-scoring ones, indicating that compliance with certain key dimensions contributes significantly to Total Score.\n\n\nDiversity Among High-Scoring Companies:\n\n\nThe dispersed nature of high-scoring companies suggests variability in how these companies achieve high Total Scores. For instance, some companies might excel in workplace environment dimensions, while others might focus more on compensation and benefits.\n\n\nHomogeneity of Low-Scoring Companies:\n\n\nLow-scoring companies cluster more tightly, implying that their poor performance is likely due to consistent non-compliance across multiple assessment dimensions."

It highlights similarities in company practices and explores how these clusters correlate with CEO Gender, Total Score, and key financial indicators we have identified in the EDA stage which has significant differences between male- and female-led companies: Gross Profit, Revenue from Contract with Customer, Compensation Expense, and Accounts Receivable. The results aim to uncover meaningful patterns and provide insights into organizational behaviors and their impact on gender equality and financial outcomes.\n\n# Select columns containing \"Assessment\"\nassessment_columns = [col for col in data.columns if \"Assessment\" in col]\n\n# Ensure no missing values and convert 'Met' to 1 and 'Unmet' to 0\ndata_cleaned = data[assessment_columns + ['CEO Gender', 'Total', \n    'GrossProfit (k)', 'RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax (k)',\n    'AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense (k)', 'AccountsReceivableNetCurrent (k)']].dropna()\n\ndata_cleaned[assessment_columns] = data_cleaned[assessment_columns].apply(\n    lambda col: col.map(lambda x: 1 if x == 'Met' else 0)\n)\n\n# Standardize the data\nscaler = MinMaxScaler()\nassessment_data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data_cleaned[assessment_columns])\n\n\n# Determine the optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score\ninertia = []\nsilhouette_scores = []\nK = range(2, 10)  # Number of clusters from 2 to 9\n\nfor k in K:\n    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)\n    kmeans.fit(assessment_data_scaled)\n    inertia.append(kmeans.inertia_)\n    silhouette_scores.append(silhouette_score(assessment_data_scaled, kmeans.labels_))\n\n\n# Visualize Elbow Method\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 5))\n\n# Elbow Method\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nplt.plot(K, inertia, marker='o')\nplt.title('Elbow Method: Optimal K')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Clusters (K)')\nplt.ylabel('Inertia')\n\nText(0, 0.5, 'Inertia')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Visualize Silhouette Score\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nplt.plot(K, silhouette_scores, marker='o')\nplt.title('Silhouette Score: Optimal K')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Clusters (K)')\nplt.ylabel('Silhouette Score')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the optimal number of clusters k: - As seen in the Elbow Method plot, the inertia decreases significantly as k increases but begins to level off after k=7, suggesting that adding more clusters beyond this point provides diminishing returns in terms of reducing the within-cluster variance. -

This likely indicates that the companies in this cluster excel consistently across most assessment variables.\n\n\nMiddle Performers:\n\n\nCluster 1 and Cluster 2 represent mid-range performers, with median Total Scores around 10-12. These clusters might include companies that meet some, but not all, gender equality standards.\n\n\nLow Performers:\n\n\nCluster 3 and Cluster 4 represent companies with the lowest Total Scores, indicating systemic weaknesses in meeting gender equality assessments. These clusters could be targeted for improvement strategies.\n\nInterpretation for Clusters:\n\nHigh-Performing Clusters (0 and 5):\n\n\nThese clusters likely consist of companies that excel in meeting gender equality assessments across multiple dimensions. They can serve as benchmarks or role models for lower-performing groups.\n\n\nLow-Performing Clusters (3 and 4):\n\n\nThese clusters should be analyzed to identify specific areas of weakness in assessment variables, providing actionable insights for improvement.\n\n\nDiversity in Cluster 1 and 6:\n\n\nThe wide variation in Cluster 1’s and Cluster 6’s Total Scores suggests a mix of companies that perform inconsistently across different assessment dimensions.\n\n\nPotential Patterns:\n\n\nThe clustering results highlight meaningful groupings in Total Scores, aligning with the K-Means model’s goal of separating companies based on assessment similarity.\n\n\n# Gross Profit vs Cluster\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x='Cluster', y='GrossProfit (k)', data=data_cleaned)\nplt.title('Gross Profit Distribution by Cluster')\nplt.xlabel('Cluster')\nplt.ylabel('Gross Profit (k)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot shows the distribution of Gross Profit (k) across the 7 clusters identified by K-Means.\nVisual Observations:\n\nDistinctive Patterns Across Clusters:\n\n\nCluster 0 stands out with significantly higher gross profit values compared to all other clusters. The gross profit for companies in this cluster is consistently above 1.5×10^8, indicating that these companies are financial outliers with exceptional performance.\nCluster 1 also shows notable gross profit values but exhibits more variation compared to Cluster 0. The median is around 2。0×10^7, with a wide range, suggesting that Cluster 1 contains both mid-range and high-performing companies.\n\n\nHomogeneity in Lower-Performing Clusters:\n\n\nClusters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 display significantly lower gross profit distributions.\nThe median values across these clusters are close to zero, with minimal variation, suggesting that companies in these clusters operate on a much smaller financial scale or have limited profitability.\nOutliers exist in Cluster 3, where one company shows a slightly higher gross profit compared to the cluster average.\n\n\nGross Profit as a Key Differentiator:\n\n\nClusters 0 and 1 are financially distinct from the rest of the clusters. These two clusters may represent companies that operate at a much larger scale or have optimized their financial operations for higher profitability.\nThe lower-performing clusters (2-6) indicate companies that may struggle to achieve significant gross profit or operate in less profitable industries.\n\nInterpretation for Clusters:\n\nCluster 0:\n\n\nThese companies are financial leaders and may also perform well in gender equality assessments due to available resources to invest in such initiatives.\n\n\nCluster 1:\n\n\nThese companies are moderately profitable and may have varying levels of resources to implement gender equality practices.\n\n\nClusters 2-6:\n\n\nCompanies in these clusters face financial constraints, which might limit their ability to invest in gender equality initiatives or workplace improvements.\n\n\n# Revenue vs Cluster\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x='Cluster', y='RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax (k)', data=data_cleaned)\nplt.title('Revenue Distribution by Cluster')\nplt.xlabel('Cluster')\nplt.ylabel('Revenue (k)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis boxplot illustrates the distribution of Revenue from Contract with Customers (k) across the 7 clusters.\nVisual Observations:\n\nDistinct Revenue Patterns Across Clusters:\n\n\nCluster 0 demonstrates significantly higher revenue values compared to other clusters. Companies in this cluster have revenues consistently above 3.5×10^8, marking them as financial outliers.\nClusters 2 and 5 show moderate revenue levels. Cluster 2 exhibits higher median revenue among the clusters, with a broad range extending up to 0.8×10^8. Cluster 5 has a even higher median revenue compared to Cluster 2, with a much narrower range of values.\n\n\nHomogeneity Among Lower-Revenue Clusters:\n\n\nClusters 1, 3, 4, and 6 display significantly lower revenue distributions. Median values for these clusters are close to zero, indicating that companies in these clusters operate at a smaller financial scale.\nCluster 3 has a single outlier, with revenue slightly higher than the rest of the companies in the cluster.\n\n\nRevenue as a Key Differentiator:\n\n\nCluster 0 clearly separates itself as the top-performing group in terms of revenue, likely representing companies with a much larger operational scale or market dominance.\nClusters 2 and 5 occupy the middle ground, representing moderately successful companies in terms of revenue generation.\nClusters 1, 3, 4, and 6 highlight companies with minimal revenue, possibly indicating financial challenges or operation within less lucrative sectors.\n\nInterpretation for Clusters:\n\nHigh-Performing Cluster (Cluster 0):\n\n\nThese companies generate substantially more revenue and may have greater resources to invest in initiatives such as gender equality or workplace improvements.\n\n\nModerate-Performing Clusters (Clusters 2 and 5):\n\n\nThese clusters consist of companies with respectable revenue but not at the scale of Cluster 0. They may represent a mix of stable but smaller companies with the potential for growth.\n\n\nLow-Performing Clusters (Clusters 1, 3, 4, and 6):\n\n\nThese clusters highlight companies that may struggle with financial performance, potentially limiting their ability to address broader organizational improvements, such as gender equality initiatives.\n\n\n# Compensation Expense vs Cluster\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x='Cluster', y='AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense (k)', data=data_cleaned)\nplt.title('Compensation Expense Distribution by Cluster')\nplt.xlabel('Cluster')\nplt.ylabel('Allocated Compensation Expense (k)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis boxplot illustrates the distribution of Allocated Share-Based Compensation Expense (k) across the 7 clusters identified in the K-Means analysis.\nVisual Observations:\n\nDistinct Expense Patterns Across Clusters:\n\n\nCluster 0 shows significantly higher compensation expenses compared to all other clusters, with a narrow range around 8×10^6. This suggests that companies in this cluster allocate substantial resources to share-based compensation, likely indicating larger or more established organizations with significant employee equity programs.\nCluster 1 and 5 also show relatively higher compensation expenses compared to other clusters. Cluster 1 has a wider range and a median around 0.4×10^6. Cluster 5 has a median around 0.9×10^6. Companies in these clusters represent moderately high spenders on share-based compensation.\n\n\nHomogeneity in Lower-Spending Clusters:\n\n\nClusters 2, 3, 4, and 6 display significantly lower compensation expense distributions:\nMedian values across these clusters are close to zero, indicating minimal or no allocation to share-based compensation for companies in these groups.\nCluster 3 has a single outlier with a slightly higher expense compared to the rest of the companies in the cluster.\n\n\nCompensation Expense as a Differentiator:\n\n\nThe stark differences in compensation expenses between Cluster 0 (outliers), Cluster 1 and 5 (moderate spenders), and the remaining clusters highlight compensation expense as a key differentiator among companies.\nClusters with minimal expenses (2, 3, 4, and 6) likely represent smaller companies or those that do not prioritize share-based compensation as part of their employee benefits strategy.\n\nInterpretation for Clusters:\n\nHigh-Spending Clusters (0, 1 and 5):\n\n\nCompanies in these clusters may represent financially stronger organizations that invest heavily in retaining and incentivizing their employees through equity-based compensation.\nThese clusters might correlate with higher scores in gender equality or workplace initiatives, as such practices often reflect broader investment in organizational improvement.\n\n\nLow-Spending Clusters (2, 3, 4, and 6):\n\n\nThese clusters highlight companies that likely operate on a smaller scale or in industries where share-based compensation is less common.\nTheir limited resource allocation to compensation might also correlate with challenges in other organizational metrics, including gender equality initiatives.\n\n\n# Accounts Receivable vs Cluster\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x='Cluster', y='AccountsReceivableNetCurrent (k)', data=data_cleaned)\nplt.title('Accounts Receivable Distribution by Cluster')\nplt.xlabel('Cluster')\nplt.ylabel('Accounts Receivable (k)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis boxplot visualizes the distribution of Accounts Receivable (k) across the 7 clusters identified by the K-Means algorithm.\nVisual Observations:\n\nHigh-Performing Cluster (Cluster 0):\n\n\nCluster 0 has significantly higher accounts receivable values compared to all other clusters. The median value for this cluster is above 2.5×10^7, indicating that these companies operate at a much larger financial scale and likely have more substantial receivables due to higher sales or extended credit terms to customers.\n\n\nModerate-Performing Cluster (Clusters 5):\n\n\nCluster 5 exhibits relatively higher accounts receivable values among other clusters with a median accounts receivable of approximately 1.2×10^7.\n\n\nLow-Performing Clusters (Clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6):\n\n\nClusters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 display significantly lower accounts receivable values. Their median values are close to zero, indicating that these companies operate on a smaller financial scale or have limited credit sales activity.\nCluster 4 is particularly consistent with almost no variation, suggesting a group of very small companies.\n\n\nAccounts Receivable as a Key Differentiator:\n\n\nAccounts receivable serves as a clear differentiator among the clusters, with Cluster 0 standing out as a financial leader. The financial scale of companies decreases progressively from Cluster 0 to Clusters 5, then to Clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n\nInterpretation for Clusters:\n\nCluster 0:\n\n\nCompanies in Cluster 0 likely operate in industries or markets where extending credit is common. Their high accounts receivable values align with their presumed larger scale of operations and potential for significant revenue generation.\n\n\nCluster 5:\n\n\nThis cluster represents companies with moderate accounts receivable, suggesting medium-scale operations or more restricted credit policies compared to Cluster 0.\n\n\nClusters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:\n\n\nCompanies in these clusters likely operate at smaller financial scales, potentially limiting their capacity for growth or credit-based sales strategies.\n\n\n# CEO Gender vs Cluster\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.countplot(x='Cluster', hue='CEO Gender', data=data_cleaned)\nplt.title('CEO Gender Distribution by Cluster')\nplt.xlabel('Cluster')\nplt.ylabel('Count')\nplt.legend(title='CEO Gender')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis count plot visualizes the distribution of CEO gender across the 7 clusters identified by the K-Means algorithm.\nVisual Observations:\n\nMale CEOs Dominate Across Most Clusters\n\n\nThe majority of clusters are dominated by male CEOs (0), reflecting the overall gender imbalance in the dataset.\n\n\nClusters with Female CEOs\n\n\nCluster 1 is the only cluster with female CEOs (1).\n\nKey Insights:\n\nLow Representation of Female CEOs:\n\n\nThe lack of female CEOs in most clusters and the minimal representation in Cluster 1 reflects a broader gender imbalance in leadership roles within the dataset. This could indicate systemic barriers to female leadership.\n\n\nCluster-Specific Patterns:\n\n\nThe presence of female CEOs in Cluster 1 suggests that this group may have distinct characteristics in terms of company operations, financial performance, or gender equality initiatives that correlate with female leadership.\n\n\nSummary of Clusters Based on K-Means Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster\nCharacteristics\nGender Equality and Respect\nFinancial Observations\n\n\n\n\nCluster 0\n- High performers with outstanding Total Scores- Consistently high Gross Profit, Revenue, Accounts Receivable, and Compensation Expenses\n- Male-dominated leadership- Represents top-performing companies with significant investments in gender equality initiatives\n- Financial leaders operating on a large scale- Significant resources enable investments in workplace improvements\n\n\nCluster 1\n- Moderate Total Scores with high variability- Mixed financial performance- Includes female-led companies\n- Includes the only representation of female CEOs- Reflects potential for balancing gender equality and financial success\n- Moderate financial resources- Variation suggests differing engagement levels with equality initiatives\n\n\nCluster 2\n- Mid-range Total Scores- Moderate Revenue and Gross Profit- Low Accounts Receivable\n- Meets some gender equality standards but has room for improvement- Limited consistency\n- Smaller companies with steady but constrained financial capacity\n\n\nCluster 3\n- Lowest Total Scores- Minimal Gross Profit, Revenue, and Compensation Expenses- Entirely male CEOs\n- Struggles significantly with gender equality initiatives- Limited progress due to financial constraints\n- Financially weakest cluster- Indicates systemic challenges in both financial performance and workplace initiatives\n\n\nCluster 4\n- Low Total Scores with narrow variance- Homogeneous with consistently low financial metrics\n- Fails to meet many gender equality standards- Represents companies with limited resources for improvement\n- Small-scale operations with minimal financial activity- Consistent underperformance across key metrics\n\n\nCluster 5\n- High Total Scores with narrow variability- Moderate Gross Profit and Revenue\n- Strong performers in gender equality- Focused and consistent engagement with equality initiatives\n- Financially mid-level companies with stable performance- Strong internal policies likely drive success\n\n\nCluster 6\n- Wide variability in Total Scores- Low financial metrics\n- Inconsistent engagement with gender equality initiatives- Reflects diversity in performance levels\n- Financially weaker cluster- Mix of improving and underperforming companies"

The systemic dominance of male leadership in these organizations underscores historical and structural barriers that have positioned men at the forefront of business leadership. Overcoming these barriers to see more female leadership in such top-performing companies will likely take time and significant systemic shifts.\n\nModerate Financial Performance with Female Representation\n\nCluster 1 is the only one cluster which includes companies led by female CEOs and demonstrates moderate financial performance compared to other clusters.\nFemale-led companies may show potential for balancing gender equality and financial performance. The presence of female leadership could contribute positively to organizational culture and workplace improvements, indirectly driving financial growth."

    "text": "Executive Summary\nThis business-oriented study analyzes the relationship between gender equality implementations, CEO gender, and financial performance across 202 companies. The findings highlight that most companies exhibit low gender equality scores, with female-led companies showing less variability and lower financial performance compared to male-led companies. The analysis suggests significant opportunities for improving gender inclusivity, which may also enhance business performance in terms of profitability and employee satisfaction. The findings are highly relevant for companies aiming to align their diversity initiatives with business success and to improve their market position by fostering a more equitable environment.\n\n\nObjective\nThis project aims to explore the intersection of gender equality and corporate financial performance. The main objectives are:\n\nTo identify how a company’s gender equality score correlates with its financial performance metrics.\nTo examine the impact of CEO gender on gender equality practices and business outcomes.\nTo provide actionable insights on how organizations can improve their gender equality measures to enhance both social and financial performance.\n\n\n\nKey Insights\n\nGender Equality in Business Practices:\n\nThe analysis reveals strong correlations between gross profit, allocated share-based compensation, and accounts receivable with the gender equality scores, suggesting that companies with gender equality tend to exhibit higher profitability, invest more in their employees, and demonstrate superior operational efficiency.\nAs shown in the bar chart below, workplace and supply chain are two crucial terms in the business practices and thus the implementation of the concept of gender equality pertaining to these two areas is highly significant. By examining the keywords in the text, we can find the action-oriented nature of the keywords concerning gender equality in supply chains. On the other hand, the concern over workplace keywords has more emphasis on policy, which is an indication of the greater attention that most companies lay on the reporting of these two factors: workplace and supply chain.\n\n\nIn addition, there are more positive emotions in the report, which might reflect that company managers want to transmit an impression to the people that their company shall be able to maintain fairness under any conditions by such positive emotions, whether or not the company genuinely fulfills this intention in practice, as shown in the following figure.\n\n\nImportance of Financial Health and Gender Equality in Procurement:\n\nThe evidence suggests that financially stable, better performing companies are more likely to procure from sources that promote the gender-equal procurement, such as women-owned enterprises. This may reflect the fact that these companies hold financial health are more likely to have some strategy of driving gender equality initiatives along the supply chain, whether intentionally or not.\n\n\nGender Representation in Leadership:\n\nTop-performing companies are predominantly led by male CEOs, reflecting the historical and structural barriers that have positioned men at the forefront of business leadership. This systemic dominance of male leadership underscores the challenges that must be addressed for greater gender parity in top leadership roles. Achieving more female representation in these high-performing organizations will likely require significant time and profound structural shifts.\nConversely, female-led companies may offer potential for balancing gender equality with strong financial performance. The presence of women in leadership positions can foster a positive organizational culture and enhance workplace dynamics, which may, in turn, contribute to financial growth. However, the underrepresentation of women in leadership roles, coupled with low gender equality scores, highlights the systemic issues that persist within these organizations.\nFinancial and governance-related factors are key in determining the gender of a company’s CEO. Based on unsupervised learning, we already know the systemic advantages of male ceos. But we wanted to explore which specific financial metrics tend to point to male CEOs and which point to female CEOs? By training gradient boosting regressor, we found that companies that have more assets and are committed to gender equality are more likely to have female ceos. On the other hand, companies with high public ownership and balanced gender representation at the governance level are more likely to hire male CEOs.\n\nIn addition, according to EDA, more female CEOs are willing to contribute to the gender pay gap.\n\n\nFactors Influencing Gender Equality Scores:\n\nSimilarly, we wanted to explore which factors significantly influence overall gender equality scores. We explored selected variables from gender-responsive procurement, financial health, and gender equality in governance. As the chart below shows, companies that demonstrate a commitment to gender equality, such as sourcing from women-owned businesses and addressing the gender pay gap, generally score higher on the gender equality assessment.\n\n\nAutomated Scoring Potential:\n\nThrough text data modeling, we can automate the assessment of a company’s compliance with gender equality in an area. In this exploration, we mainly focus on health cover. We can judge whether a company fully meets, partially meets, or does not meet the gender equality criteria related to health insurance by generating a corresponding score. This automated approach allows for scalable and efficient assessments, which can make it easier for companies and policymakers to identify gaps. Below is a word cloud of keywords for health cover compliance.\n\n\n\nBusiness Implications\n\nAddressing Gender Equality:\n\nIt indicates that existing companies have a long way to go in terms of gender equality. As the results shown, companies whose score of gender equality is higher also show for operational outcomes that might affect improved profitability and market position.\nThis should be worked on by all companies, improving gender equality not only because it fits into the social responsibility agenda but also because it yields benefits in financial terms, engaged employees, and operational efficiencies.\n\nCEO Gender and Business Performance:\n\nThe data shows that female CEOs are underrepresented and tend to lead companies with lower financial performance. This suggests that increasing the representation of women in leadership roles could have a positive effect on both gender equality and financial outcomes.\nIn addition, we can notice that CEOs of different genders tend to perform better on different financial metrics, which may imply differences in operational policies.\n\nFinancial and Operational Efficiency:\n\nProfitability differential impacts gender inclusivity practices, not in both measures of gross profit but also in finance dependent on people. Inclusiveness in the organizations would protect them from great loss due to low profitability or profit bias, especially in employee-focused and customer-related industries.\n\nThe Overlooked Impact of Gender Equality in Supply Chains:\n\nThe supply chain seems to be an overlooked factor when assessing whether a company is taking gender equality measures, because it is not a “direct” factor. However, our research found that gender equality in the supply chain is more action-oriented, and action can better reflect a company’s determination. In addition, supply chain was the factor that had the highest impact on gender equality scores among the factors we screened. Because the supply chain is an easily overlooked factor, companies that can also focus on gender equality in the supply chain will have a higher overall rating.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nEnhance Gender Equality Initiatives:\n\nCompanies should adopt more stringent gender equality policies with gender-equitable opportunities for women in leadership positions. This could be mentorship programs, gender diversity training, and policies to support work and life balance.\nThe organizations should set clear goals in terms of diversity and subsequently track progress, in which gender equality should apply at all levels in the organization.\n\nFocus on Female Leadership:\n\nIt is essential that retirement to see a significant increase in the number of women in top management. It has been proved that top management gender diversity can bring improvement in organization’s climate, job satisfaction, and general performance.\nEmployment practice is being reviewed to take into consideration that those selected as candidates for leadership roles should also include well-qualified women.\n\nLeverage Financial Performance to Support Gender Equality:\n\nOrganizations should make a concerted effort to increase the representation of female executives. Research shows that gender diversity at the top can improve organizational culture, employee satisfaction, and overall performance.\nThey should also revise their recruitment practices in order to make sure that qualified women are recruited for leadership positions.\n\nIncrease Transparency in Gender Equality Metrics:\n\nCompanies should publicly report on their gender equality progress to stakeholders. Such transparent reporting is now the norm for corporate governance best practices and has earned a good reputation among investors, employees and customers.\n\nIntroduce Automated Scoring System:\n\nWhen it comes to how well a company performs in gender equality, we can find information from its related news or reports, and we can find it requires a large quantity of time to assess its performance. Applying an automated scoring system will be an effective way in the future to evaluate and give senior management a more quantitative picture.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study shows that gender equality is not just a moral imperative but a key factor that can drive business success. Companies with higher gender equality scores tend to perform better in operational metrics, which ultimately boosts their market position. Addressing gender imbalances at the leadership level, enhancing inclusivity practices, and aligning business operations with gender equality goals will help companies improve both their social responsibility impact and their financial performance. In addition, automated evaluation processes can help ensure social oversight of corporate behavior. Moving forward, companies should integrate diversity metrics into their corporate strategy and ensure that gender inclusivity is woven into the fabric of their business operations."
