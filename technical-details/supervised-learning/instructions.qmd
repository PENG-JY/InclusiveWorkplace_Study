# Introduction and Motivation 

In recent years, much attention has been paid to the importance of gender equality in the corporate world, which is critical to promoting an inclusive environment. Through this study, we hope to explore how to create a more equitable society and strengthen aspects of corporate responsibility. Therefore, in this section, we will explore the intersection of business practices, performance and gender equality in enterprises based on supervised learning. In addition, this study explores the possibility of automatically assessing a company's gender score from text data reported by companies.

# Overview of Methods

In this study, four different supervised learning models were employed to analyze various aspects of gender equality and business practices. 

## Binary Classification

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** SVM are supervised learning models that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. It is suitable for binary classification.[@jakkula2006tutorial]

- **Logistic Regression** Logistic regression is a supervised learning model that applies primarily to two or more categories using a logical function.[@hosmer2013applied]

## Regression

- **Gradient Boosting Regression** It is a supervised learning method based on boosting in a functional space, is pseudo-residuals rather than residuals, as in conventional boosting.[@friedman2001greedy]

## Multi-Class Classification

- **Random Forest Classifier** Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning technique for classification or regression, the Random Forest Classifier will generate a large number of decision trees during training.[@belgiu2016random]
