# Introduction and Motivation

Data cleaning is a necessary step in data analysis, where our main goal is to merge different data sets and clean them to ensure consistency for next steps. We hope to ensure the stability of the model through data cleaning and explore meaningful insights into gender equality practices within the companies, especially for text data and financial data.

# Overview of Methods

First,  we will merge the company dataset with the financial data set using the CIK (Central Index Key) number as a unique identifier for each company with company gender assessment data set[@Gender2023]. As a result, we will generate a large dataset to explore more completely.

For text data, we will remove unnecessary punctuation, convert cases, remove stop words, so that we can prepare for subsequent analysis, such as TFIDF.

For data normalization, we first use Z-score normalization and then Min-Max scaling.

To deal with missing values, we apply different strategies depending on the importance of the variable. For example, for the most critical variables, CIK identifiers, we will delete all missing rows. For relatively less important variables, we use multiple imputation to fill in the missing values because these variables are valuable to the analysis.

In order to ensure consistency, some data preprocessing code of some content is displayed in the corresponding part, such as unsupervised learning, and we hope that the audience can understand the reason for our processing more coherently.
