    "2. Widely Used in Financial Ratios:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many common financial ratios use total assets as a denominator (e.g., Return on Assets (ROA) = Net Income / Total Assets). This makes it a well-accepted practice in accounting and finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cross-Indicator Applicability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all the financial indicators we would like to use (e.g., Net Income, Gross Profit, Accounts Receivable) can be effectively standardized using total assets, ensuring consistency in this approach."
