# Introduction

This project investigates the relationship between the gender of a company's CEO, its gender equality score, and financial performance. The overarching goal is to analyze whether and how gender representation and equality metrics influence business outcomes, specifically financial success.

On this page, we are focused on data collection, a foundational step in the analysis process. By gathering data on financial indicators, gender diversity metrics, and company leadership, we aim to build a dataset that will enable us to explore these relationships quantitatively.


# Motivation

The study is motivated by the increasing emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the corporate world. As organizations adopt DEI policies, understanding their tangible impacts—particularly on financial performance—has become a priority for stakeholders, including investors, policymakers, and the public. Through this analysis, we hope to uncover patterns that highlight the importance of gender representation and equality in driving business success.
