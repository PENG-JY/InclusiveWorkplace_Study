# Introduction and Motivation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) aims to initially explore the factors that influence gender equality practices within a company, with a particular focus on the data structures themselves that influence key areas such as gender equality scores and CEO gender, and how they relate to financial metrics and governance metrics.

The motivation for this analysis is that gender equality in the workplace is a trend in today's society. We want to do a preliminary exploration for the next part of machine learning to determine the direction of our future exploration.

# Overview of Methods

## Overview of Methods for Univariate Analysis

Univariate analysis is a foundational technique for understanding the distribution and characteristics of individual variables in a dataset. In this project, univariate analysis was conducted on gender-related variables, gender equality scores and CEO gender, to provide insights into the data's characteristics.

- **Descriptive Statistics**: 
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize key aspects of variables. Measures such as the mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range were calculated to assess the central tendency and dispersion of variables. In our study, we examined the distribution of gender equality scores to determine whether they were skewed towards higher or lower values.

- **Frequency Distribution**: 
Frequency analysis was performed on categorical variables such as CEO gender to understand the proportion of companies with male versus female CEOs. This helped establish a baseline for understanding gender representation in leadership roles across companies in the dataset.

- **Histogram and Density Plot**:
Used to visualize the distribution of continuous variables such as gender equality scores. This helped identify any skewness or outliers in the data.

## Overview of Methods for Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis

Bivariate and multivariate analyses were employed to investigate the relationships between two or more variables. This allowed for a deeper understanding of the interdependencies between gender diversity metrics, CEO gender, and company financial performance. These analyses were key to identifying patterns, correlations, and potential causality.

- **Z-Score Normalization and Min-Max Scaling**:
Z-Score Normalization and Min-Max Scaling were applied to the financial data to address the differences in scale between variables.

- **Histograms and Box Plots**:
Used to compare the distribution of each financial indicator between companies led by male and female CEOs.

- **Hypothesis Testing**:
For each financial indicator, hypothesis testing was conducted to determine whether there is a significant difference in the mean values between male-led and female-led companies.

- **Correlation Analysis**:
Spearman correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between financial indicators and gender equality scores.

## Overview of Methods for Text Analysis and Feature Engineering

In this project, text analysis plays a critical role in understanding the gender equality practices within companies, particularly through the lens of the evidence provided in relation to gender equality policies. To effectively analyze textual data, several techniques were employed to transform raw text into meaningful features that can be used for classification tasks.

- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**:
TF-IDF transforms text into numerical features by evaluating the importance of terms in a document relative to the whole dataset. It helps identify key terms such as "gender balance", "pay equity", and "women-owned businesses", which highlight a company’s commitment to gender equality.

- **Sentiment Analysis**:
Sentiment analysis classifies text into positive, neutral, or negative categories to assess a company's stance on gender equality issues like pay equity or harassment prevention.

- **Topic Modeling**:
Topic modeling uncovers hidden themes in company policies, helping to identify how companies address aspects like pay gap data collection, violence prevention, and gender balance in leadership.

- **Keyword and Network Analysis**:
Keyword analysis identifies frequently discussed topics related to gender equality, while network analysis visualizes relationships between key terms (e.g., "gender equality" and "pay equity") to understand company policies.

- **Feature Engineering**:
Features derived from sentiment scores, topic distributions, and keyword frequencies are integrated with numerical data to create a comprehensive dataset for machine learning, offering deeper insights into a company’s gender equality practices.
