# Introduction and Motivation

Unsupervised learning techniques are crucial for exploring hidden patterns and structures in data without predefined labels. In the context of gender equality and corporate performance, unsupervised learning allows us to identify natural groupings or relationships between companies based on financial performance, gender equality scores, and leadership diversity. These techniques are particularly useful when we aim to discover intrinsic patterns, such as how certain corporate characteristics correlate with higher gender equality scores or financial success.

In this study, we aim to use unsupervised learning methods to uncover underlying patterns within the dataset of companies' financial indicators and gender equality measures. By clustering companies based on these characteristics, we can identify different groups of companies that exhibit similar profiles in terms of gender equality, leadership diversity, and financial performance. The insights from these clusters can help uncover systemic barriers, trends, or areas for potential improvement in corporate governance and inclusivity practices.

By leveraging unsupervised learning techniques, we aim to:

1. Reveal patterns in corporate behavior related to gender equality.
2. Explore the association between financial performance and diversity metrics.
3. Identify outliers or high-performing companies that demonstrate exceptional gender equality practices.

This section will focus on how unsupervised learning models, such as clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques, were applied to analyze company performance and gender equality.

# Overview of Methods

In this study, two unsupervised learning models were employed: Dimensionality Reduction (PCA and t-SNE) and K-Means Clustering.

## Dimensionality Reduction

- **PCA**: PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables known as principal components. These components explain the maximum variance in the data. PCA was used in this study to reduce the complexity of the dataset and identify the most important factors that explain variability in gender equality scores. By applying PCA, we could better visualize the data and identify which assessment dimensions (e.g., workplace environment, compensation and benefits, prevention of violence and harassment) had the greatest influence on the total score.[@mackiewicz1993principal]

- **t-SNE**: t-SNE is another dimensionality reduction technique, particularly effective for visualizing high-dimensional data in a two- or three-dimensional space. It works by minimizing the divergence between probability distributions in high-dimensional space and their corresponding distributions in lower dimensions. In this study, t-SNE was also applied to explore how companies clustered together based on their gender equality scores.[@van2008visualizing]

## K-Means Clustering

K-Means was used in this study to group companies based on their performance across gender equality assessment dimensions. The goal was to identify clusters of companies that exhibited similar behaviors in gender equality implementation, and how these clusters correlate with CEO Gender, the total score, and key financial indicators. K-Means is particularly suitable for this analysis because it can handle large datasets with high-dimensional features and works well for identifying natural groupings in the data.[@hamerly2003learning]
