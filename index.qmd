`Note`: These audio instructions should not be included in your final submission or repository, once you are done wiht them, please delete the files and remove them from the website. 

## Getting Started

To begin the project, first read the instruction document ([click here](instructions/overview.qmd)). This document is also accessible from the navigation bar.

Once you’ve completed that, you can proceed with the instructions found throughout the website.

## What to Include on This Page

This is the landing page for your project. Content from this page can be reused in sections of your final report.

### Create an "About You" Page  

- Develop your "About You" page. You can reuse content from previous assignments.
- You can include the content here or on a separate page.
   - It’s recommended to create one "About You" page for all DSAN projects, with links to your various class projects.

### Create a Landing Page for Your Project  

- Summarize your topic, its significance, related work, and the questions you plan to explore.
- Draft an introduction with at least **5 research questions**. These may evolve as your project progresses, since data science is an iterative process.
- Include your data science questions on this page.

### Literature review

Once you decide on a topic, you should `ALWAYS START WITH A LITERATURE REVIEW`, this is particularly important for academic projects.

The literature review is the most important part of most projects. 

It allows you to; 

* 1. Determine what is already known and what has already been tried, so that you `don't re-invent the wheel`.
* 2. It makes you more of a subject matter expert, allowing you to `ask the right questions`, `target impactful projects`, and `communicate with other professionals`.

> Doing a project that you think will change the world, only to find at the end that a very similar version of your project was already done in the 1980's, isn't a great use of time.

In this section, please do a literature review and cite at least **3 academic publications** per group member, and include **internal academic citations**.

**Optional**: Consider using LLM tools to 10X your literature review, e.g. instead of focusing on 3 papers, aim for 30 or more

By following these steps, you can 10X the efficiency of your literature review process, gaining more insights while minimizing the time spent on manual reading.

1. **Expand Your Literature Search**  
   Aim to gather a larger pool of papers. Use academic databases (Google Scholar, arXiv, etc.) to find relevant studies and ensure a broad scope.

2. **Skim the Abstracts**  
   Read the abstracts of each paper to quickly understand their focus and identify those most relevant to your topic. Prioritize these papers for deeper analysis.

3. **Use LLM Tools for Summarization**  
   Upload the selected papers to an LLM tool capable of text summarization. Have it condense the main points of each paper into a concise, manageable summary (e.g., condense hundreds of pages into a 10-page summary). Carefully review this summary to absorb the key insights.

4. **Leverage Interactive LLM Tools**  
   Use tools like NotebookLM or other AI-based text digesters to ask specific, targeted questions about the papers:
   - Example questions:
     - "In the papers uploaded, did any of them explore XYZ?"
     - "Which paper is most closely related to the following project idea: [explain idea]?"
   These tools will help you quickly extract relevant information without re-reading entire papers.


## Additional Ideas for things to include 

- **Audience**: Who is this for? Data professionals, businesses, researchers, or curious readers.
- **Headline**: A captivating title introducing the data science theme (e.g., "Unlocking Insights Through Data Stories").
- **Introduction**: A brief, engaging overview of what the website offers (e.g., data-driven stories, insights, or case studies).
- **Questions You Are Addressing**: What do you hope to learn?
- **Motivation**: Explain why this topic matters, highlighting the importance of data in solving real-world problems.
- **Key Topics**: List the main focus areas (e.g., machine learning, data visualization, predictive modeling).
- **Use Cases/Examples**: A brief teaser of compelling stories or case studies you’ve worked on.
- **Call to Action**: Invite visitors to explore the content, follow along, or contact you for more information.
- **Visual/Infographic**: Add a simple graphic or visual element to make the page more dynamic.

# Exploring the Intersection of Gender Equality and Financial Performance: Analyzing Leadership and Organizational Practices

## Introduction

## Literature review

Enterprises are an important economic organization that is widespread in society. How to create an inclusive environment at the firm level, especially for gender equality, is a very important proposition that we would like to study in conjunction with the financial health, governance structure and business practices of firms.

Reviewing previous research on the association of gender inequality with other factors at the firm level, Hoogendoorn et al. (2013) found that gender-balanced teams in business teams were more likely to have better sales and profit performance, although no direct factors were found to support this difference. Eagly and Heilman (2016) mentioned that the business case of “female participation enhances corporate financial performance” and argue that more in-depth analysis is needed if this idea is to be validated. Simionescu et al. (2021) argue that female board members have a positive impact on corporate performance, particularly in terms of price-earnings ratios. All of the above were studied using traditional qualitative analysis methods or econometric methods.

## Questions We Are Addressing

Is there a gender inequality problem in North American companies?

Does a company’s gender equality score have an impact on the company’s financial performance? And conversely, how does a company’s financial performance influence its commitment to gender equality practices?

Does the gender of a company's CEO have an impact on the company's financial performance?

How do financial indicators and operational factors influence a company's decision to procure from women-owned businesses?

How can textual evidence in reports be used to automate the assessment of a company’s performance in gender equality and healthcare standards?
