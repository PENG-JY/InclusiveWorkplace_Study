## Getting Started

To begin the project, first read the instruction document ([click here](instructions/overview.qmd)). This document is also accessible from the navigation bar.

Once you’ve completed that, you can proceed with the instructions found throughout the website.

## What to Include on This Page

This is the landing page for your project. Content from this page can be reused in sections of your final report.

### Create an "About You" Page  

- Develop your "About You" page. You can reuse content from previous assignments.
- You can include the content here or on a separate page.
   - It’s recommended to create one "About You" page for all DSAN projects, with links to your various class projects.

### Create a Landing Page for Your Project  

- Summarize your topic, its significance, related work, and the questions you plan to explore.
- Draft an introduction with at least **5 research questions**. These may evolve as your project progresses, since data science is an iterative process.
- Include your data science questions on this page.

### Literature review

Once you decide on a topic, you should `ALWAYS START WITH A LITERATURE REVIEW`, this is particularly important for academic projects.

The literature review is the most important part of most projects. 

It allows you to; 

* 1. Determine what is already known and what has already been tried, so that you `don't re-invent the wheel`.
* 2. It makes you more of a subject matter expert, allowing you to `ask the right questions`, `target impactful projects`, and `communicate with other professionals`.

> Doing a project that you think will change the world, only to find at the end that a very similar version of your project was already done in the 1980's, isn't a great use of time.

In this section, please do a literature review and cite at least **3 academic publications** per group member, and include **internal academic citations**.

**Optional**: Consider using LLM tools to 10X your literature review, e.g. instead of focusing on 3 papers, aim for 30 or more

By following these steps, you can 10X the efficiency of your literature review process, gaining more insights while minimizing the time spent on manual reading.

1. **Expand Your Literature Search**  
   Aim to gather a larger pool of papers. Use academic databases (Google Scholar, arXiv, etc.) to find relevant studies and ensure a broad scope.

2. **Skim the Abstracts**  
   Read the abstracts of each paper to quickly understand their focus and identify those most relevant to your topic. Prioritize these papers for deeper analysis.

3. **Use LLM Tools for Summarization**  
   Upload the selected papers to an LLM tool capable of text summarization. Have it condense the main points of each paper into a concise, manageable summary (e.g., condense hundreds of pages into a 10-page summary). Carefully review this summary to absorb the key insights.

4. **Leverage Interactive LLM Tools**  
   Use tools like NotebookLM or other AI-based text digesters to ask specific, targeted questions about the papers:
   - Example questions:
     - "In the papers uploaded, did any of them explore XYZ?"
     - "Which paper is most closely related to the following project idea: [explain idea]?"
   These tools will help you quickly extract relevant information without re-reading entire papers.


## Additional Ideas for things to include 

- **Audience**: Who is this for? Data professionals, businesses, researchers, or curious readers.
- **Headline**: A captivating title introducing the data science theme (e.g., "Unlocking Insights Through Data Stories").
- **Introduction**: A brief, engaging overview of what the website offers (e.g., data-driven stories, insights, or case studies).

# Exploring the Intersection of Gender Equality and Financial Performance: Analyzing Leadership and Organizational Practices

<img src="./assets/undraw_working.svg" />

## Introduction

This project delves into the intersection of gender equality and financial performance, exploring how organizational practices and leadership impact business outcomes. Through data-driven analysis, we examine how factors like CEO gender, company policies on diversity and inclusion, and financial performance correlate with organizational success. The website provides a comprehensive introduction to these topics, offering actionable insights into the relationship between gender equality and financial performance through data analysis and visualization. We hope that this website can provide some valuable findings that can guide organizations in making more inclusive and financially successful strategic decisions.

## Literature review

Enterprises are an important economic organization that is widespread in society. How to create an inclusive environment at the firm level, especially for gender equality, is a very important proposition that we would like to study in conjunction with the financial health, governance structure and business practices of firms.

Reviewing previous research on the association of gender inequality with other factors at the firm level, Hoogendoorn et al. (2013) found that gender-balanced teams in business teams were more likely to have better sales and profit performance, although no direct factors were found to support this difference. Eagly and Heilman (2016) mentioned that the business case of “female participation enhances corporate financial performance” and argue that more in-depth analysis is needed if this idea is to be validated. Simionescu et al. (2021) argue that female board members have a positive impact on corporate performance, particularly in terms of price-earnings ratios. All of the above were studied using traditional qualitative analysis methods or econometric methods.

## Questions We Are Addressing

Is there a gender inequality problem in North American companies?

Does a company’s gender equality score have an impact on the company’s financial performance? And conversely, how does a company’s financial performance influence its commitment to gender equality practices?

Does the gender of a company's CEO have an impact on the company's financial performance?

How do financial indicators and operational factors influence a company's decision to procure from women-owned businesses?

How can textual evidence in reports be used to automate the assessment of a company’s performance in gender equality and healthcare standards?

## Motivation

The intersection of gender equality and financial performance is an important area of research, especially as today's society increasingly recognizes that with diverse leadership, high levels of inclusion in a company are an important indicator that a company has a human face and promotes growth. A wealth of data plays a key role in understanding these dynamics, including financial data and textual data from company reports, which provide insights that can drive meaningful change in the way companies operate. By examining the relationship between gender equality policies, leadership, and economic success, the project aims to highlight how we can make the environment more inclusive and the benefits of fostering an inclusive environment. The results of this research can empower organizations to make data-backed decisions that not only promote gender equality, but also improve the long-term sustainability of their companies. In an era where we need to pursue not only economic growth, but also social progress, understanding these connections is critical to creating an organization that positively develops and makes an inclusive contribution to society.

## Key Topics

- **Data Collection and Cleaning**:
We combined the 2023 Gender Benchmark data set from World Benchmarking Alliance with data scraped from EDGAR API, ensuring comprehensive coverage of gender-related metrics and financial performance indicators. In addition, we also applied data cleaning to ensure the effectiveness of data analysis.

- **Selecting Financial Performance Metrics**: 
This section identifies the key financial indicators that best reflect a company’s financial health and how they relate to gender equality practices and outcomes.

- **Data Visualization**: 
Presenting data-driven insights through interactive charts, graphs, and infographics to communicate trends and patterns.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: 
Using techniques like PCA and t-SNE to reduce high-dimensional data into more understandable patterns, helping us visualize the key factors that influence companies' gender equality scores.

- **Clustering and Segmentation**: 
Grouping companies based on similar characteristics (e.g., Total Scores) to identify patterns and trends across different financial and gender equality metrics.

- **Classification and Regression**: 
Applying machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to classify companies based on gender equality levels or to predict continuous variables like gender equality scores.

- **Feature Engineering**: 
Selecting, transforming, and creating features from raw data (e.g., financial metrics, text data from policies) that help improve model accuracy and provide insights into the relationship between gender equality and company performance.

## Use Cases/Examples
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

- **Clustering Companies by Gender Equality Performance**: 

Through unsupervised learning techniques like PCA and t-SNE, we segmented companies into clusters based on their gender equality scores. This analysis uncovered that top-performing companies often cluster in specific financial metrics, while mid-range performers show overlap, indicating diverse strategies for achieving gender equality goals.

- **Gender Equality in Supply Chains**: 

We explored how companies’ procurement from women-owned businesses correlates with their overall gender equality scores. This case study used feature engineering and predictive modeling to assess how procurement practices affect companies' gender equity efforts and financial outcomes.

- **Automated Evaluation of Compliance with Gender Equality Standards**: 

Using supervised learning model and NLP techniques, we developed a model to automatically assess whether a company's actions and policies meet certain gender equality standards based on the text from their public reports. We can evaluate if companies are meeting gender equality benchmarks, such as gender balance in leadership, anti-harassment policies, and equal pay practices. This automated evaluation allows for scalable and efficient monitoring of company practices, providing a data-driven way to assess compliance with gender equity standards without manual review.
