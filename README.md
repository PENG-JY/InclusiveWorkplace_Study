# Exploring the Intersection of Gender Equality and Financial Performance: Analyzing Leadership and Organizational Practices

## Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between gender equality practices and financial performance in organizations, focusing on how different organizational factors, such as leadership gender and company policies, affect business outcomes. We aim to analyze company data and evaluate their gender equality score, CEO gender, procurement practices, and other related organizational factors using machine learning techniques.

The project leverages various machine learning models, including supervised learning (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) and unsupervised learning (PCA, t-SNE), to explore key trends and insights regarding gender equality in the workplace and its implications for business success.

## Purpose of the Project

The key objectives of the project are:
1. To analyze the impact of gender equality on financial performance.
2. To explore the role of gender representation in leadership positions on business success.
3. To develop models to predict gender equality scores and evaluate whether financial stability influences gender equality practices.
4. To use text analysis techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis, keyword network analysis) to assess gender-related policies from company reports.
